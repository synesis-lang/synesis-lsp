  abstract  = {To satisfy California's large petroleum requirements, hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil and its refined products are shipped annually through its coastal waters and into ports. In addition, tens of million of barrels of petroleum are produced each year from offshore oil wells and transported ashore by subsea pipelines. Consequently, the California marine environment, including sensitive biological resources and amenity resources, is under continual threat of damage as a result of accidents that lead to spills of oil. The use of burning as an available oil spill response method can play an important role in reducing the possible widespread impact of oil spills to marine resources. The use of this technology, however, often requires the approval of many different oversight agencies and its use has often been very controversial. This paper outlines the current efforts being spearheaded by the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) in the California Department of Fish and Game, to develop an in-situ burning policy to address oil spills in the open-water marine environments of the State. It describes the importance of early coordination and cooperation amongst the stakeholders in an in-situ burning decision, the formation of a working-group, and a discussion of the consensus approach integral to current policy development efforts. The author concludes with a description of the pertinent sections of the draft policy, a discussion of current projected timeline for completion of the finalized in-situ burning policy, plans for public review and comment on the draft policy and procedures for policy adoption and integration into appropriate State and Federal Plans. The implications of ``negative public perception'' regarding the use of in-situ burning will be discussed and future plans for a public outreach and education program will be outlined.},

Despite the benefits of reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, the adoption of electric vehicles faces several obstacles ranging from financing issues, government policies, and public acceptance. This study aims to identify the economic, environmental, and social impact of the adoption of electric vehicles for public transportation. Using the Philippines as a case study, the findings highlight the economic advantage of investing in electric public transportation with high public acceptance. The results further identify significant decrease in air pollution, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and encourage lowering the reliance on imported fossil fuels by shifting the public transport from conventional to electric transport system. This study recommends stricter implementation of government policies on modernized public transportation, stronger government support on financing mechanisms, establishment of charging stations in public and private terminals, and boosting programs for developing local-made electric vehicles. To make electric vehicle more environment-friendly, the government must accelerate the energy transition by increasing the electricity share from renewable sources and investing in more sustainable sources of energy.},

Notably, most of empirical literature has focused on the global northern countries, with bottom-up transition governance structure. In this paper, we study attitudes towards photovoltaics in Iran, as a fossil fuel-rich country of the global south, with a top-down energy transition structure and committed to UNFCCC. We focused on governmental organisations as a key stakeholder group regarding their role in winning public acceptance. Aiming at finding determinants of attitudes towards PV, we conducted 15 qualitative interviews in 10 governmental organisations in Golestan, Guilan and Tehran. Taking an inductive approach to the data, we considered the acceptance and attitude theories as sensitising concepts to investigate common and specific issues in terms of social acceptance in Iran. We find accessing electricity and diversifying electricity resources via PV as the key technical drivers, and the upstream policies as the key political drivers towards PV adoption. Though the weak policies (design and implementation), privileging economic and technical obstacles, do hinder the PV adoption and shape negative attitudes toward it. We realise that the previous literature overlooked the fossil fuel-rich countries and their energy transition governance structure. Our findings imply that better-designed upstream policies with a more enabling policy framework are needed to motivate actions on the governmental organisation level.},

My main research questions are: (i) which factors drive solar businesses to establish and do business in the solar PV field despite the fossil-based economy and energy policies in Iran? (ii) what are the practical barriers to solar business in Iran? and (iii) which roles do Iranian solar businesses play in bringing solar PV development forward? I collected the data via 20 semi-structured interviews with solar businesspeople in diverse Provinces in Iran. Taking an inductive approach (Grounded Theory) toward the data, my results lead to significant insights: the dominance of intrinsic behavioural drivers over the major extrinsic barriers among Iranian solar businesspeople, moreover to their key roles in educating people and driving the innovative deployment of solar PV. This research helps to inform first, policymakers about the existing potential among solar businesses, and second the solar businesses themselves about adopting better business strategies.},

This paper focused on using both traditional and bibliometric analysis approaches to review the marine energy industry. It also assessed the various opportunities and challenges in the sector beyond technological challenges using PESTEL analysis. The results from the study identified the availability of renewable energy targets, international and national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets, job creation, skill transfer from offshore industries, renewable support, and low GHG emissions as the major opportunities for the sector. The challenges in the sector include the lack of commonality in device designs, high initial capital costs, lack of appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks, lack of funding, fragmentations in regulatory institutions, bad macro -economic indicators in some countries, environmental challenges, the survivability of the various technologies in the harsh oceanic environment, and strong competition from other renewable energy sources. The outcome of the bibliometric analysis spanning from 2013 to 2023 shows that tidal power is the focus of research in the field, and most studies are either focused on ways to improve its efficiency in terms of technology or on the identification of resource potentials for the siting of the various marine renewable power systems. Recommendations such as strong cooperation between the government and private sector, increased public education, collaboration with existing players in the marine sector, and increased research and development, among others, were proposed for the development of the sector.},

This study aims to assess the impacts of these transition plans on social equity in a case study of the southern coast of Iran, where the community faces severe water scarcity and there is ready access to seawater for desalination. The main contribution of this research is to consider social equity as a key factor in the nexus evaluation of energy-water transition plans. Considering different system types (integrated versus separated) and configurations (centralized or decentralized, components, and technologies), it proposes interconnected water-energy transition scenarios with consideration of spatial and temporal changes. In order to achieve more realistic and sustainable water-energy supply planning, the study focuses on a quantitative distributive justice evaluation of the proposed scenarios, with consideration of related social equity theories and Iran's particularities, using the following proxy indicators: subsidies, taxation, job creation, NOx emissions, as well as environmental concerns. In the proposed scenarios with decentralized desalination, shifting a portion of job creation and subsidies for desalination and their renewable energy supply from urban areas and reallocating them to rural areas led to a balance in the distribution of benefits and burdens between rural and urban households, while addressing the issue of excluding rural households from the benefits and opportunities provided by renewable-powered desalination projects.},

  abstract             = {Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) has been recognized as an important means of mitigating global climate change, but apart from several pilots, it has not yet been successfully implemented on the large scale needed to live up to the expectations as a mitigation method. In Netherlands, the option of CCS has been the subject of debate for a long time, as three unsuccessful projects - two onshore in Barendrecht and the Northern regions, and one offshore near the Port of Rotterdam - demonstrate. Nevertheless, CCS has been accorded an important place in the current Dutch climate policies, being expected to contribute up to 7 Megaton of CO2 reduction. This is reflected in a fresh crop of CCS project plans. For the most, these plans have a long way to go from the drawing board to actual operations due to the technical, economic, legal and societal challenges ahead. In this article we review the status and possibilities of CCS in Netherlands based on an analysis of existing literature in the relevant disciplines. First, a brief overview of the technology options for carbon capture and storage or utilization is given. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the governmental support for CCS, given the vital role that fit-for-purpose legal frameworks and policy instruments will play in CCS deployment. Technical, legal and policy uncertainties translates into factors inhibiting CCS investment and so the paper then presents a CCS investment project to illustrate how such risks affect the business case for CCS. Finally, bearing in mind that societal acceptance has proved to be a major barrier for CCS, both in Netherlands and elsewhere, the conditions that enhance public acceptance of CCS are examined. Our work shows that while CCS is technically a straightforward proposition, its deployment has historically been hindered by the lack of a sound business case and a compelling and stable socio-technical narrative. The main argument in favor of CCS today is that it offers a transition pathway for rapidly and massively reducing CO2 emissions beyond what could be accomplished by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels in near future. The introduction of new financial instruments, increased government support and an improvement in social engagement appear to have enhanced the prospects of CCS in Netherlands, but we feel it is premature to assume that this time everything is different.},

  abstract             = {In the current context of global warming, where district cooling systems are increasingly burdening power grids worldwide, it is important to design and operate alternative systems that are not only environmentally friendly, but also cost effective for sustainable energy transition. This paper investigates the potential of two, previously unexplored, solar cooling systems while considering economic and environmental criteria: a Solar Thermal and Electrical Cooling System (STECS) that relies solely on solar energy, offering a significant environmental advantage, and a Hybrid Solar Cooling System (HSCS) that combines a compression chiller and an absorption chiller for improved efficiency. First, novel Mixed -Integer Linear Programming models are proposed to aid in generating cost-effective designs and operations for each of STECS and HSCS. Second, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is adapted to evaluate both systems and benchmark them against conventional cooling systems previously studied in the literature. The proposed framework allows decision makers to assess the potential of these systems using three criteria; namely, cost, carbon dioxide emissions, and noise levels, which are crucial for ensuring the social acceptance of district cooling technologies worldwide. A computational study is presented to show the practical relevance of the proposed framework using realdemand data obtained from an educational district in the State of Qatar. Results show that the integration of solar energy into conventional cooling systems has the potential to significantly reduce the annual total net cost by 61%, CO2 emissions by 60%, and noise levels by 53%, on average. Additionally, the benchmark results demonstrate that the zero -carbon dioxide emissions solar cooling system achieves the highest overall performance score when all criteria are considered together.},

This systematic review assesses key criteria for identifying suitable co-location sites; focusing on environmental regulations, resource availability, economic viability, social acceptance, and technological readiness. The study highlights that environmental protection laws and legal limitations are the primary factors affecting site feasibility, in addition to factors such as distance from existing infrastructure and economic considerations. Despite potential benefits, the existing challenges are the early stage of FPV technology and its low resilience in offshore environments. The findings underline the potential of co-located OWF-FPV projects to reduce the costs associated with offshore renewables, particularly in densely populated coastal areas with limited land availability. Strategic resource allocation and policy support are essential for overcoming these obstacles and promoting the development of sustainable offshore energy solutions. These findings serve researchers and practitioners alike, by offering insights for a better allocation of resources and efforts to foster the co-location development of OWF and FPV in the future.},

It does so by reviewing a variety of literature across several disciplines addressing socio-technical dimensions of energy transitions. The tipping dynamics in wind and solar power create potential for cascading effects to energy demand sectors, including household energy demand. These most likely start with shift actions and adoption of household-scale batteries and heat pumps. Key enablers are strong regulations incentivising reductions in demand and setting minimum efficiency levels for buildings and appliances. While there is evidence of spillovers to more environmentally friendly behaviour, the extent of these and the key leverage points to bring them about present a knowledge gap. Moreover, these behavioural feedback loops require strong additional policy support to ``make them stick''. Understanding the economic and social tipping dynamics in a system can empower decision-makers, fostering realistic energy transition policies. This paper highlights energy communities as a promising niche for leveraging tipping dynamics. Ultimately, bridging the gap between these tipping dynamics and institutional reforms is crucial for unlocking the full potential of sustainable energy systems.},

  abstract             = {Energy transition will reshape the power sector, and hydrogen is a key energy carrier that could contribute to energy security. The inclusion of sustainability criteria is crucial for the adequate design/deployment of resilient hydrogen networks. While cost and environmental metrics are commonly included in hydrogen models, social aspects are rarely considered. This paper aims to identify the social criteria related to the hydrogen economy by using a systematic hybrid literature review. The main contribution is the identification of twelve social aspects which are described, ranked, and discussed. ``Accessibility'', ``Information'', ``H2 markets'', and ``Acceptability'' are now emerging as the main themes of hydrogen-related social research. Identified gaps are e.g., lack of the definition of the value of H2 for society, insufficient research for ``socio-political'' aspects (e.g., geopolitics, wellbeing), scarce application of social lifecycle assessment, and the low amount of works with a focus on social practices and cultural issues.},

  abstract             = {Saudi Arabia has taken major steps to shift from an oil-centered to more environmentally-focused economy. One approach made recently is to enable households to possess and generate electricity by using small-scale residential solar photovoltaic systems (RSPSs). However, the number of applications to install this technology in residences is significantly low. Social acceptance of solar energy is essential for a successful energy transition. Hence, the present study aims to examine factors that may potentially motivate or impede individuals from purchasing RSPSs based on the diffusion of innovations theory. A cross-sectional, web-based survey is conducted including 1498 participants from the five main regions of Saudi Arabia. Results revealed a good cognition level in relation to solar energy, where the majority (64-83%) of respondents are aware of the benefits. An overwhelming proportion of the respondents (97%) associate RSPSs with a significantly positive image, with no significant variation in the acceptance or rejection rates among the five areas covered by the survey (p = 0.1). The results also show high statistical significance for the differences between RSPS acceptors and rejecters in all innovation attributes (p ¡ 0.001). However, the perception of relative advantage has a higher correlation with acceptance RSPSs. These perceived advantages were of rather long-term nonfinancial benefits, such as environmental protection against global warming and provision of unlimited power, rather than the revenue related to direct costs benefits. The study also revealed that the installation cost was the most significant barrier to adopting the RSPS, which can be a focus for RSPS dissemination policies.},

Hence identifying and analysing the underlying barriers for the deployment of large-scale renewables are essential. This study investigates the barriers to large-scale solar power in Tanzania. Key institutional, financial, and technological barriers are identified at different levels. The study uses a qualitative methodology where primary data is collected through 30 semi-structured interviews with experts representing the main electricity sector's stakeholders from public institutions, research institutions, private investors, civil society organizations, development partners, and financial institutions. A stakeholder-based approach which emphasizes the different perceptions of the stakeholder's groups is used to identify the barriers. Institutional barriers for the diffusion of large-scale solar power technologies are found to be predominant, and they often trigger financial and technological barriers. The study consolidates the view that foreign investment and aid directed to expand electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be reshaped in order to be a driving force towards sustainable energy transition in the region. The study argues for the possibility to work on the compatible interests between the pro-renewables development partners and the Tanzanian government (which considers expanding electrification as a political priority) through introducing large-scale solar power projects that help in expanding electrification while being technically and financially supported by the development partners.

  abstract             = {Advocacy for energy efficiency solutions in non-residential buildings, particularly within the public sector, is part of the response to the climate crisis by the European Union (EU). Traditional building energy management systems (BEMS) focus primarily on technological advancements but often overlook the influence of occupant behaviour on energy consumption. This study develops a set of five design principles aimed at bridging this sociotechnical gap by integrating behavioural strategies with technical solutions. Following a design principle (DP) development framework, informed by an integrative literature review and the abstraction hierarchy (AH) method, the study proposes actionable guidelines for designing BEMS architectures. With the aim of supporting future BEMS blueprints, a conceptual architecture is created based on the design principles. A BEMS proof-of- concept (PoC) demonstrates how to apply the design principles and the architecture to potentially optimise the use of renewable energy sources in a public sector building. The minimum reusability evaluation framework is employed to evaluate the proposed principles theoretically. The novelty of this work lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which goes beyond previous studies by offering normative guidance that balances both technology and human factors. These findings suggest that a sociotechnical approach to BEMS design can significantly enhance energy efficiency, offering valuable insights for stakeholders, such as system designers and energy managers. Future research should focus on real-world implementation and empirical validation of the proposed principles.},

Based on recent scholarly work interested in researching the interlinks between domestic heating use and non-domestic energy practices and infrastructures, it proposes to understand domestic heating as the practical outcome of existing heating ecologies, which are defined as the dynamic interrelations of in-home and out-home heating infrastructures and practices. The argument empirically unfolds using material from six months of ethnographic fieldwork that focused on a heater replacement policy program in central and southern Chile. Using the data we collected from participant observation and follow-up interviews, we describe the installation phase and establishment of new less polluting heaters, as well as how the installation of those new heaters problematizes and redefines preexisting heating ecologies that constitute domestic and non-domestic practices and infrastructures linked to firewood heating. We focus on two specific aspects of this change which proved to be particularly relevant in terms of the adoption of the new heaters: first, the change in the infrastructures and practices of fuel provision and, second, the change in the infrastructures and practices of maintenance and repair. The article ends by suggesting that further understanding of heating ecologies - their dynamics and changes - could be a critical element for explaining the success or failure of low carbon domestic technological transitions and policy intervention.},

However, technological innovation of CCS has recently stagnated, and therefore, CCS still exists largely as a technological imaginary, is shaped more by narrative than by physical reality. This study examines how narratives or imaginaries of CCS technology were constructed in four major Japanese newspapers from 2006 to 2013. Based on a discourse analytic approach, we identify three dominant storylines of CCS: (1) the promise of large CO2 storage capacity; (2) the compatibility with the fossil energy regime; and (3) the forefront of high-tech innovation. The results show that all three storylines are strongly in favor of CCS, inflating blind optimism in the technical prospects of CCS while ignoring the many risks and uncertainties around it. Given the complexities of CCS as a socio-technical system, however, the role of media narratives is to enhance broader social learning about CCS. The paper argues that more plural, balanced, and critical narratives are required to sustain a sound balance between uncertainty and optimism over CCS.},

  abstract             = {Whilst carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been promoted as a direct countermeasure against global warming, there remains much debate about what its final role as a climate change mitigation strategy will be. One key criticism directed towards CCS has been its inability to gain public support. This study compares public attitudes to the range of low carbon energy sources and technologies across Australia and China, and is the first study to compare primary data across these two countries on this topic. An online survey encompassing a broad set of questions was used to identify the factors that are associated with support for CCS compared to other energy technologies. Data were collected from a nationally representative Australian sample (n= 2383) and from Chinese urban residents across six regions (n= 1266). The survey confirmed low levels of knowledge and support for CCS in both countries. However, male respondents, those who perceived themselves to have higher knowledge of CCS, and those who valued economic outcomes over environmental protection were more likely to support CCS - as long as the risks were not perceived to outweigh the benefits. The results found that for Australians who believed in human-induced climate change they were likely to be unsupportive of CCS. This opposition appears to be linked to no tolerance for extending fossil fuels as in our factor analysis CCS was aligned to fossil fuels in Australia. In both countries, support for renewable energy technologies remains strong. Given the International Energy Agency's future energy demand projections, combined with slow progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, the lack of knowledge and support for CCS is concerning. While there have been some technological advances, without parallel improvements in public acceptance of CCS, it will be difficult to see any commercial projects going forward in the near future. Although, the Chinese government's success in educating on climate science, as evidenced in these results, suggests that they may be more effective at informing the public of the benefits of CCS and take the lead on its deployment for climate change mitigation. Based on the latest climate models, it is almost crunch time for governments to decide if CCS has a role to play as part of an energy transition to a low carbon future or perhaps it may be time to turn their focus to climate adaptation.},

  abstract  = {Environmental monitoring at geologic CO2 storage sites is required by regulations for the purposes of environmental protection and emissions accounting in the case of leakage to surface. However, another very important goal of environmental monitoring is to assure stakeholders that the project is monitored for safety and effectiveness. With current efforts to optimize monitoring for cost-effectiveness, the question remains: will optimization of monitoring approaches degrade stakeholder assurance, or do heavily-instrumented sites communicate higher risk to a stakeholder? We report the results of a stakeholder survey in Gulf Coast states of the US where carbon capture and storage (CCS) is developing quickly. We rely on a 2 by 2 factorial experiment in which we manipulate message complexity (complex v. simple) and social norm (support from scientists v. support from community members). Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) complex message with scientist support; 2) complex message with community member support; 3) simple message with scientist support; or 4) simple message with community member support. In addition to the experimental stimuli, subjects were also asked about their need for cognition, attitudes toward science and scientists, attitudes about climate change and support for carbon capture and storage (CCS). Our sample is drawn from residents in states bordering the western Gulf of Mexico (Texas, Louisiana, Florida) where CO2 geologic storage is being planned both onshore and offshore. The results offer important implications for public outreach efforts to key stakeholders.},

Utilizing an exhaustive literature search from 2001 to 2023 via the Scopus database, the study identifies strong policy frameworks, technological advancements, economic incentives, and international collaborations as pivotal factors in successful energy transitions. Case studies from the Nordic countries, Germany, and Poland highlight diverse approaches and significant progress, revealing valuable lessons for global application. Although energy literacy emerges as crucial for public acceptance and participation, fostering informed decision-making and supportive behaviors toward renewable energy initiatives, energy justice ensures equitable access to the benefits of energy transitions, addressing socio-economic impacts on marginalized communities. The study identifies a scarcity of research that articulates and integrates energy literacy and justice concurrently within the purview of energy transition. The paper recommends the adoption, integration, and institutionalization of frameworks that concurrently propagate energy literacy and guide fair and equitable energy transitions. The frameworks should encourage active community involvement, promote community ownership of renewable energy projects, ensure transparency and inclusivity, implement measures for equitable economic benefits, protect livelihoods, address historical distrust, and leverage social media to promote energy literacy and justice. Finally, the continuous monitoring and evaluation of energy transition initiatives are crucial to ensure that they meet evolving societal needs and environmental goals.},

  abstract      = {The transitions literature has framed energy transitions as a process involving material and social consequences. Such radical changes can also be viewed as constituting discursive dimensions, involving debate, idea exchange and value positioning. The implementation of a biomass energy system in residential buildings in a socioeconomically deprived community near Liverpool, UK, is investigated for its acceptance by, and impacts on, the community. A mixed -methods approach involving questionnaire, focus group and interview data reveal how practical, on -the -ground energy transitions are understood at the community level. Given the changes to how residents pay for their energy in the study community, from prepayment meters to pay -as -you -use methods, considerations of `efficiency' are debated and framed on the cost of energy rather than from an environmental performance perspective. Although the intention of low -carbon energy transitions in low-income communities is to deliver economic and environmental benefits, many unintended social consequences arose from top -down decision -making choices and implementation mechanisms. These processes exacerbate economic inequalities and inequities. Justice implications arising from this study have clear repercussions for future implementation of similar, and additional, sustainability interventions that attempt to address climate change in the built environment. ractice relevance The successful implementation of a decentralised energy system requires more than a technological approach. This case study emphasises the need for extensive community engagement when undertaking local energy transitions. In particular, attention needs to be given to how vulnerable people are affected by pricing and given clear information on how to use the new system. Policy recommendations include: the choice of energy technologies should not disrupt vulnerable residents' daily routines and ability to pay; the provision of substantial pre-, during and post -installation community engagement is needed to improve familiarity with new energy systems; and adequate opportunities for listening and responding to residents' concerns prior, during, and after the installation of low -carbon energy systems.},

This review paper identifies and examines three crucial research areas concerning GH. Despite significant federal, state, and business investment in the development of hydrogen technology, numerous questions have remained unanswered including economic viability, social acceptance, and policies and regulations. In comparison to the US, Europe, and Asia have taken a lead role in studying the social and regulatory aspects of GH. The study shows limited focus on social acceptance, and the absence of dedicated policies and regulations for hydrogen. The US lacks coordinated policies for GH and is blended with natural gas. The literature shows that the relationship between economics, social sciences, and policies and regulations are intrinsic. The success of GH in the US will require massive investments, public and private collaboration, research on social sciences, and regulatory support. Hence, the GH rollout will bridge the energy transition, and climate and development targets which guide future industrial, government and public decisions.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Siting renewables facilities in off-shore locations would appear to reduce this tension but, as yet, limited research has been conducted on public attitudes to marine renewables-particularly tidal and wave power-to establish how genuinely `out of sight and out of mind' such developments are in the public mind. This paper presents a quantitative study of public opinions on a test site for wave energy currently under construction near the coast of the Southwest UK. The findings suggest general public support for wave energy as an economically beneficial method of power generation with few adverse side-effects. The merits of quantitative and qualitative research on public attitudes towards renewable-energy technologies are then discussed and concepts of risk and reward perception are used to explore the possible future dynamics of public attitudes towards `future' renewables technologies like wave energy. We conclude with reflections on risk and reward perceptions as a heuristic device for defining future directions for research on public attitudes towards different renewable-energy technologies.},

We argue that the individual-level perception measures are insufficiently developed within this field, while they are vital for a successful just energy transition. Reviewing studies on how people (citizens, users or consumers) perceive fairness in the context of the energy transition, we first investigate how fairness perceptions are currently studied within energy social science. Subsequently, we look into social and environmental justice research and interdependent decision-experiments, to map potential extensions of fairness conceptualizations and measures. Following the triumvirate model of energy justice - distinguishing distributive, procedural, and recognitive justice - we found that only recently studies also contained recognition justice aspects, while the majority of energy social science studies focuses on either distributive or procedural aspects. Extending these insights, we argue that environmental justice research provides a potential way of specifying groups to be recognized in the energy transition (i.e., future generations, non-human species, humans worldwide). Moreover, we propose that interactional justice could be an additional tenet of citizen's fairness perceptions to consider. Importantly, for a successful global energy transition, in-depth insight into the principles underlying people's justice judgments is necessary. Social justice theorizing and interdependent decisionexperiments offer concrete ways of tapping into these principles. Interdependent decision-experiments in particular pose a way of measuring fairness tendencies that could be applied to the specific context of the energy transition and be expanded beyond the current research focus measuring distributive justice perceptions.},

In this paper a series of potential future energy systems are generated with the EnergyPlan software for the Faroe Islands before these systems are assessed using a set of criteria covering their environmental, social, technical and economic aspects. These criteria are used by two multi-criteria approaches, along with actual weights obtained from local stakeholders, to rank the energy systems. It is found that there is a clear shift in rankings towards systems employing offshore technologies due to the inclusion of social criteria specifically fitted to the Islands??? resident???s preferences. This shift, however, was not sufficient for these offshore scenarios to outperform other scenarios that performed well on the other criteria. These findings indicate there is likely value in terms of local acceptance for transition planning on the Islands in adjusting to include greater quantities of offshore technologies in future energy strategies.},

When Iceland opened the commercial-grade direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) facility in 2021, this marked a breakthrough for DACCS technology as a scalable climate mitigation solution. This study investigates the adoption of DACCS in Iceland and the potential for diffusion into other contexts as a global decarbonization solution. We implement expert interviews to analyze the adoption of technology, and to identify the various requirements of scaling DACCS into local and global contexts. Using inductive thematic analysis, we characterize the diverging perspectives on the role of carbon dioxide removal as a climate mitigation solution and also identify pathways toward technology upscaling at national, regional, and global scales. Despite the successful technology demonstration of DACCS, we find that experts hold different mental models of climate mitigation generally, characterized as ``nature vs. technology.'' We also find that experts clearly articulate the necessary conditions for the diffusion of DACCS more broadly, including explicit regulatory measures as guardrails against a ``license to pollute'' as well as bilateral governance structures that include financial investment. Finally, we find that the importance of public acceptance of the technology was noted among all expert groups. Limited data exist on the acceptance of DACCS paired with renewable energy and this is a future research recommendation.},

  abstract             = {The German Energiewende (energy transition) has increased the degree of decentralisation in the electricity infrastructure. This article proposes a framework for assessing this technological development from an economic perspective as well as a social one. Four infrastructure dimensions are addressed: the grid level, infrastructure location, flexibility, and balancing generation and supply. Firstly, the impact of decentralisation on these dimensions is assessed concerning economic efficiency. The analysis shows that depending on the technological dimension assessed a decentralised electricity infrastructure has the potential to increase or decrease overall system costs. Secondly, the social perspective is operationalised through three forms of participation, namely procedural, democratic representative and financial participation. The analysis highlights the chances to increase participation through increasing technological decentralisation and points towards the important role of the project-initiating actors on the local level who decide whether options for participation are realised and in what manner. The article does not provide a final answer about whether centralised or decentralised electricity systems are preferable. It highlights the range of dimensions that need to be considered when discussing future decentralised electricity scenarios or making policy decisions.},

In line with this, technology acceptance is of great importance as resistance from the public can slow down or hinder the construction of energy technology projects. The current study assesses the social acceptance of three energy technologies relevant for the German energy transition: stationary battery storage, biofuel production plants and hydrogen fuel station. Methods An online survey was conducted to examine the public's general and local acceptance of energy technologies. Explored factors included general and local acceptance, public concerns, trust in relevant stakeholders and attitudes towards financial support. Results The results indicate that general acceptance for all technologies is slightly higher than local acceptance. In addition, we discuss which public concerns exist with regard to the respective technologies and how they are more strongly associated with local than general acceptance. Further, we show that trust in stakeholders and attitudes towards financial support is relatively high across the technologies discussed. Conclusions Taken together, the study provides evidence for the existence of a ``general-local'' gap, despite measuring general and local acceptance at the same level of specificity using a public sample. In addition, the collected data can provide stakeholders with an overview of worries that might need to be addressed when planning to implement a certain energy project.},

An online survey is conducted by examining the visual impact (location and design) of BS on acceptability. Analyses indicate that BS is more readily accepted in industrial and rural areas compared to residential areas or the participants' immediate neighborhoods. Adapting the design of BS to its surroundings can help to increase acceptability in residential areas, whereas battery storage design does not significantly influence acceptability in locations further away from homes. Finally, findings concerning public support for diverse mitigation measures with regard to the siting of BS in residential areas show that environmental mitigation measures are most supported. The findings support the notion that the location and design of BS affect technology acceptability. When possible, BS should be built away from residential areas, for which acceptability is rather low. On the other hand, especially industrial areas emerge as a promising location for siting battery storage, with acceptability being very high. If BS is built close to or in residential areas, attention should be paid to minimizing visual intrusion by adapting the exterior of the infrastructure toward its surroundings.},

This paper examines public opinion in two neighboring jurisdictions that experienced a hydraulic fracturing boom: Saskatchewan and North Dakota. Survey data is used to describe and compare opinions on fracking, clean energy, and energy transition. We find that compared to people in Saskatchewan, North Dakotans actually see less of a conflict between clean energy and fracking: they are more supportive of both. We examine predictors suggested by previous research, but aim to more carefully separate economic ideology, partisanship, and economic ties to industry. Economic ideology functions as expected, in essentially the same way across jurisdictions. Partisanship is clearly correlated to attitudes towards energy policy in North Dakota, but the relationship is asymmetric by party and issue. The same asymmetry is not true in Saskatchewan. In North Dakota, there is substantial public support for more investment in clean energy, but much less support for energy transition, while in Saskatchewan, the issue is not politicized.},

This transition cannot ignore the renewable resources available from 70% of the Earth (namely, the oceans and seas). This concept is fundamental for the planet, especially for the Mediterranean area. Marine renewable energies are still under-deployed in the Mediterranean area for many reasons, including legislative constraints, lower energy availability, and technological readiness. An appropriate participatory process including all actors (e.g., policymakers, firms, citizens, and researchers) is necessary for a correct path toward decarbonization. The BLUE DEAL project was conceived and implemented by 12 Mediterranean partners to tackle these issues and set the route for blue energy deployment in the Mediterranean area. Activities already conducted include a survey to probe the perceptions and attitudes of citizens toward blue energy. The survey targeted about 3,000 persons in 12 Mediterranean sites with the aim of bringing citizens into the discussion on future technologies. The results showed that although blue energy is still relatively unknown to the general public (only 42% of respondents were aware of these technologies), there was a general willingness (70%) to host one or more such installations in their areas. Here, we describe our survey method and some empirical results with suggestions for replicability and recommendations on how to use it for policymaking purposes.},

We combine extensive literature review, expert interviews and own readings from our two decades-long professional career in the RE sector of Nepal to arrive at rational conclusions. Almost all past internationally funded and government-subsidized off-grid solar and wind energy projects failed upon discontinuation of funds. Furthermore, the pristine Himalayan environment was forced to bear the burden of hazardous waste management. Nepal, being one of the best countries for hydropower, should concentrate on this technology. The suitability, convenient availability of other feasible alternatives and social acceptance decides the fate of technologies. Donations/subsidies need to be better utilized by developing a bottom-up ``ecosystem'' fostering new technologies to be a part of the energy mix sustainably. Through this paper, we provide specific recommendations for the use of donations and subsidies in the RE sector which have been drawn from the Nepal case but are applicable to the Global South in general.},

We aim to achieve two objectives: to create a robust model identifying key socio-economic and climate perception variables affecting household energy behaviour; and to compare the respective impacts of these factors. Applying a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 323 households across 49 districts and three physiographic regions (high hills, mid hills and Terai plains) of Nepal. We fixed the explanatory and response variables through literature review and evaluated three ordinal logistic regression models: one focused solely on socio-economic factors, the second only on climate perception and the third a composite model integrating both. Data statistics showed that 47 % of the respondents preferred no change to their existing energy status, 23 % opted to rely completely on grid-electricity, 14 % favoured switching to renewables, while 16 % preferred an optimal combination of grid-electricity and renewables for their household use. The Composite-model was found to be the best fit model for our dataset. The identified key socio-economic factors include urbanization, education levels, and the availability of energy alternatives indicating a wide disparity in the energy access and use across the different socio-economic categories of Nepal. Likewise, magnitude and timing of summer and winter rainfall, changes in the household energy demands and community level subsidies were found to be the significant climate change perception variables. Hence, our findings highlight the need for better access to modern energy and financial incentives, mostly to the rural remote areas, and community-awareness initiatives throughout the country supported by comprehensive energy policies for sustainable renewable energy transition at the household level as well as in mitigation of the impacts of climate change. By enhancing this policy-science-society interface, our research contributes valuable insights for developing effective strategies to promote renewable energy adoption in similar developing contexts.},

Small machines have traditionally not received the same level of aerodynamic refinement as their larger counterparts, resulting in lower efficiency, lower capacity factors, and therefore a higher cost of energy. In an effort to reduce this gap, research programs are developing worldwide. With this background, the scope of the present study is 2-fold. In the first part of this paper, an overview of the current status of the technology is presented in terms of technical maturity, diffusion, and cost. The second part of the study proposes five grand challenges that are thought to be key to fostering the development of small wind turbine technology in the near future, i.e. (1) improving energy conversion of modern SWTs through better design and control, especially in the case of turbulent wind; (2) better predicting long-term turbine performance with limited resource measurements and proving reliability; (3) improving the economic viability of small wind energy; (4) facilitating the contribution of SWTs to the energy demand and electrical system integration; (5) fostering engagement, social acceptance, and deployment for global distributed wind markets. To tackle these challenges, a series of unknowns and gaps are first identified and discussed. Based on them, improvement areas are suggested, for which 10 key enabling actions are finally proposed.},

However, evidence shows some problematic trends in the literature: (i) A bias toward specific agents and geographies, which overlooks mesoscale actors (e.g., media, unions, NGOs) and developing and eastern countries; (ii) instrumental and normative views of transitions, which coincide with a prevailing focus on cognitive processes and a selective bias toward technologies, policies, places, and natural resources conceived as instrumental to decarbonization. This also emphasizes how biophysical processes, people-nature relationships, and the role of emotions in understanding the psychology of agents and decarbonization processes are almost absent; (iii) a research gaze normatively oriented toward the future, which risks neglecting continuity-discontinuity dynamics and the timing and pace of transitions.},

One theme in the literature has been the roles of general attitudes towards renewable energy and perceptions of specific projects in shaping public acceptance of offshore wind farms. A survey of 196 residents of two Rhode Island communities that would be most affected by a proposed wind farm off the coast of Block Island reveals that support for the project is shaped by both general attitudes and project-specific beliefs. General attitudes also have substantial influence on project-specific beliefs. Planning processes should engage the public in discussions of both specific project characteristics and larger issues regarding renewable energy.},

This model assumes that public opposition to technology is based on a lack of quality information. The siting of facilities, such as commercial wind farms, frequently face opposition from residents of local communities, despite broad public support for renewable energy. Although social science has been critical of the information-deficit model, providing information to the public can influence both the substance and quality of attitudes. In this study, residents of coastal communities in Michigan, supportive of wind energy on average, were provided in-depth information about wind energy. Compared with a control group, participants who attended information sessions exhibited greater change in both their general support for wind energy and the strength of those attitudes. Possible implications for the siting of wind farms and other renewable projects are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Wind turbines located in the ocean contribute to the ongoing global transition to renewable sources of electricity, but further expansion of this technology will depend as much on social acceptance as on technological know-how. This article explores how underlying values and beliefs about the ocean influence public support for offshore wind energy. An intercept survey was conducted with more than 600 individuals on Block Island, site of the first offshore wind farm in the United States. Following a values beliefs-norm framework, this survey measured respondents' underlying values, anticipated impacts of the proposed wind energy project, attachment to the island, and beliefs about the ocean. The results indicate that ocean beliefs and underlying values have direct and indirect associations with expectations and support for an offshore wind energy project development. These findings provide insights into objections that arise over offshore wind farms, by acknowledging that the probability of conflict increases when one interpretation of the marine environment is imposed on people holding different beliefs about the ocean. Understanding these dynamics and integrating them into planning dialogues may be critical for successfully navigating the broader energy transition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Concerns about distributive fairness contribute to opposition to export of electricity and public preferences for electricity to be consumed near its production. Distributional issues are relevant to offshore wind energy development, where the coastal communities nearest to the developments may see none of the jobs, economic development, or profits associated with development, with undersea cables often delivering the electricity to faraway places. In a survey of coastal residents in the northeast United States, we find differences in support for use of offshore wind energy in their own state. Support for electricity use by other states, however, reveals the effects of subnational regionalism. Residents of Rhode Island prefer the use of electricity produced off their shores by the state of Massachusetts over New York; residents of New Hampshire prefer for Maine to consume energy over Massachusetts. These findings portend conflicts over the transmission of electricity as offshore wind energy development expands in U.S. and has implications for all renewable energy transmission that crosses regional boundaries.},

In this study, an intercept survey captured viewpoints of visitors to and seasonal residents of Block Island (U.S.A.) prior to, during, and after construction of a nearshore, five-turbine development. A novel two-item measure reveals increased levels of acceptance over time and positive correlations between acceptance and having seen construction activities or the completed project. Regression and path analyses are consistent with values-beliefsnorms (VBN) theory, with underlying values (particularly altruism) and beliefs about the ocean and effects of the wind energy development explaining a substantial share of tourists' acceptance of the project. These findings suggest that rather than following narrow desires for an uninterrupted seascape, tourists' responses to offshore wind energy developments are influenced by deeper beliefs and guiding principles.},

  abstract      = {Green energy refers to energy derived from renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, which are environmentally sustainable. It aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate environmental impacts. In the Turkish context, alongside positive sentiments regarding the establishment of energy plants, there are also prevalent negative perspectives. Societal responses to the transition towards green energy can be effectively gauged through the analysis of individual comments. However, manually examining thousands of comments is both time-consuming and impractical. To address this challenge, this study proposes the integration of the Transformer method, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique. This study presents a defined NLP procedure that utilizes a multi-labeled NLP model, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of comments on social media classified as ``dirty text''. The primary objective of this investigation is to ascertain the evolving perception of Turkish society regarding the transition to green energy over time and to conduct a comprehensive analysis utilizing NLP. The study utilizes a dataset that is multi-labeled, wherein emotions are not equally represented and each dataset may contain multiple emotions. Consequently, the measured accuracy rates for the risk, environment, and cost labels are, respectively, 0.950, 0.924, and 0.913, whereas the ROC AUC scores are 0.896, 0.902, and 0.923. The obtained results indicate that the developed model yielded successful outcomes. This study aims to develop a forecasting model tailored to green energy to analyze the current situation and monitor societal behavior dynamically. The central focus is on determining the reactions of Turkish society during the transition to green energy. The insights derived from the study aim to guide decision-makers in formulating policies for the transition. The research concludes with policy recommendations based on the model outputs, providing valuable insights for decision-makers in the context of the green energy transition.},

  abstract             = {There is increasing competition for space in coastal seas as new industrial sectors, such as Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) and Aquaculture, seek to expand. Multi-Use - involving sharing of space and, in some cases, facilities - can lessen competition and reduce industry costs if societal and economic challenges can be overcome. An example societal challenge is that of gaining Social Licence to Operate (SLO) for `Multifunctional Offshore Installations' (MOI) combining fish farming with MRE (from wind and waves) in a large floating structure. This article reports a mixed-methods study at two potential MOI deployment sites in 2019, aiming to understand the local context for SLO. A survey was carried out in Reggio Calabria, Italy, with 108 respondents, and in Islay, Scotland, with 127 respondents. Questions concerned opinions about MRE and fish-farming, separately and combined. A facilitated workshop in Reggio Calabria provided additional qualitative data. Most findings were the same in both places. Respondents thought better of MRE than fish-farming but remained moderately likely to eat fish produced in MOI. The majority distrusted regulators to control environmental impacts of the technology. The main differences were that respondents in Reggio Calabria anticipated local benefits from MOI industrial activity, and were more likely to accept development by non-local owners than were people on Islay. We interpreted the findings in a conceptual framework that combines theory for SLO with theory for Action Situations, hypothesising that a community's diffuse and perhaps heterogenous opinions might `crystalise' around an issue during an Action Situation. The hypothesis will be tested when a prototype MOI is deployed near Reggio Calabria in 2021.},

This study identifies the barriers and motivators affecting the energy transition from the perspective of three decision-making levels: a) formal social units, b) collective decision-making units, and c) individual consumers engaging in joint contracts; and technological foci that constitute the core of EU Energy Efficiency Directive. We present a literature review that identifies approaches to the barriers and motivators before demonstrating the results of qualitative analysis on transcripts of 67 in-depth interviews and 15 focus groups across six EU member and associate countries. This study identifies emerging themes regarding the decision-making levels and technological foci, assesses the degree of alignment between the existing literature and the perspectives of these respondents from different decision-making levels, and suggests how these perspectives can be translated into policy recommendations. An important finding of the study is that barriers are frequently described as being confined to lower level collective decision-making units, whereas the transition to low carbon is deemed inevitable for higher levels. Therefore, in addition to communication, a significant role in enabling energy transition is played by personal and social factors, which should be considered in policy-making.},

Energy transition calls for empowering citizens and communities regarding energy-related initiatives. Of particular importance are smart energy systems and their potential for involving individuals and communities in energy transition initiatives. However, not all citizens are willing to invest in renewable energy or smart appliances. Thus, there is a need for implementing smart energy initiatives, which have three main steps, namely, awareness, mindset (readiness for action), and action. Bearing in mind the lack of uniformity in this area across the European Union, this manuscript assesses the levels of awareness, mindset, and action utilizing the results of a comprehensive international survey, the ECHOES project, with respect to demographic and socioeconomic variables, such as age, income level, and education level. The analysis reveals that 58% of respondents from the West European sample demonstrate a high level of awareness, 56% are ready for action, and 63% already demonstrate action. The percentages are similar for the East European sample, with 56% demonstrating a high level of awareness, 55% are ready for action, and 66% already demonstrating action. Overall, women have higher levels of awareness, readiness for action, and action. For both Western and Eastern European countries, education level and income level are important factors for smart energy adoption, with education levels proving to be more significant for East European countries.},

This study systematically analyses current literature to scrutinise the encountered resistance in transitioning toward a lowcarbon economy. It extensively investigates the factors driving resistance across micro, meso, and macro levels, specifically focusing on three technology categories: consumer technologies, renewable energy, and smart energy systems. By synthesising insights from diverse studies that explore the political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of resistance, the primary aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge on energy transition and to provide insights that support more socially sustainable and democratic pathways toward low-carbon societies. Moreover, this study presents policy recommendations to address existing and potential resistance and opposition in this transition. Highlighting the distinctive aspects of each resistance case stresses the significance of acknowledging local intricacies and nuances in comprehending and addressing this resistance.},

Such communities can assume a central role in the development of sustainable energy systems because they are able to include and involve many people and have the potential to provide answers to problems of social and economic inequality and the energy crisis. A major problem identified is that traditional governance tools for establishing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) often prioritize the technical aspect rather than encouraging active stakeholder involvement. The overall goal of this study is to improve the environmental impact of individuals and the community by proposing a method, engagement projects and activities, and operational planning tools to support policy-making processes to build conditions in which participation in the energy system can trigger virtuous behaviour, developing a certain amount of self-sufficiency in terms of management. We will argue that this method of engagement influences the extent to which parties can or cannot engage in the whole framework of collective management of Energy Communities. To exemplify this approach, we present an experience still in progress in establishing the first Solar Energy Community in the city of Cagliari, to demonstrate how the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in renewable energy projects can help produce a spatial, social, cultural and economic context that can adapt to changing circumstances, capacity demands, technological innovations, demographic, economic and social trends.

This pilot study investigates public support for the Swiss national energy strategy and two specific technologies that are part of it: expansion of hydropower and deep geothermal energy. It addresses two research questions. First, how does public support for a national energy transition differ from public support for specific technologies endorsed in an energy transition strategy? Second, are there differences in the factors influencing public support for these technologies? We investigate these questions empirically with a survey (N = 640), focusing on understanding the role lay-people's expectations about the future energy system, political ideology, and future orientation play in generating support for these two levels of public support and for two technologies with different characteristics. We find that while support for an energy transition is well explained by above factors, this is true to a much lesser extent for technology support. One conclusion is that support for an energy transition and for energy technologies is politicized to varying degrees, which is why their acceptability may be less shaped by their objective characteristics, but rather by subjective perceptions and beliefs the public holds towards them.},

We employed affective image analysis, a structured method based on free associations to explore positive and negative connotations and affective meanings. Affective image analysis allows to tap into affective meanings and to compare these meanings across individuals, groups, and cultures. Data were collected among university students in Norway (n = 106) and Germany (n = 125). A total of 25 energy transition pathway components were presented to the participants who generated one free association to each component by indicating the first that came to mind when thinking of the component. Participants evaluated their associations by indicating whether they considered each association to be positive, negative, or neutral. These associations were coded by two research assistants, which resulted in 2650 coded responses in the Norwegian sample and 2846 coded responses in the German sample. Results for the two samples are remarkably similar. The most frequent type of association is a general evaluation of the component, for example concerning its valence or its importance. The second most frequent types of association are requirements needed to implement the component (e.g., national policies) and consequences of the component (e.g., personal or environmental consequences). Individual behaviors (e.g., walking) elicited thoughts about consequences and requirements, but also about the prevalence of such behaviors. Associations in response to technologies (e.g., carbon capture and storage) mainly referred to some descriptive aspect of the technology. Evaluations of the free responses were predominantly positive, but some components also elicited negative associations, especially nuclear power. The free associations that people generate suggest that they have vague and unspecific knowledge about energy transition pathways, that they process them in an automatic and intuitive rather than deliberative manner, and that they have clear affective evaluations of the presented components.},

  abstract             = {A framework to account for social acceptance in the modelling of energy-transition pathways is outlined. The geographical focus is on the Nordic-Baltic energy region and the technological focus is on onshore wind power and power transmission, which are considered key technologies in achieving carbon-neutral energy systems in northern Europe. We combine qualitative analysis of social acceptance with quantitative assessments of scenarios using techno-economic energy-system modelling. Key factors in and consequences of social acceptance are identified, especially environmental, health, and distributional factors, as well as costs for developers and society. The energy system analysis includes four scenarios illustrating the system effects and costs of low social acceptance. The results indicate that if low social acceptance were to restrict investments in onshore wind power, costlier solar photovoltaics and offshore wind power would step in. Greater social acceptance cost for onshore wind and transmission lines favours local solutions and a more balanced renewable energy mix. There are important distributional effects: no restrictions on transmission line investments benefit power producers while raising consumer prices in the Nordic-Baltic energy region, while very low social acceptance of onshore wind power would lead to 12% higher consumer costs. The results imply that socio-technical and political factors such as social acceptance may significantly affect transition pathway scenarios based on techno-economic variables alone. Therefore, the techno-economic, socio-technical and political layers of co-evolution of energy systems should be considered when analysing long-term energy transitions. It is important to link energy-system models with a consideration of the dynamics of socio-technical factors.},

  abstract             = {Societal opposition has the potential to slow down the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). One of the difficulties is that the perceived benefits associated with a CCS facility for local communities tend to be low compared to its perceived burdens. As is the case for other low carbon technologies, community compensation (or community benefits) has been suggested as a way to restore this perceived imbalance. A diverse literature has looked into the role of community compensation across various land uses and research fields. Synthesis is limited, while at the same time, the provision of community compensation in practice is moving from an ad hoc to a more institutionalized approach. Therefore, it is important to take stock of the literature. This paper provides a review of the community compensation literature in the form of four debates, drawing together environmental social science research on different low carbon technologies (e.g. CCS, renewable energy). In addition, current practices in community compensation for four European countries are discussed. The two parts of this paper are brought together in a set of lessons for the provision of community compensation for future CCS projects; in turn, suggestions for further research are made to address remaining knowledge gaps.},

Addressing the uneven uptake of DERs across households and their underperformance in meeting energy targets, the review emphasizes understanding consumer decision-making processes. Prioritizing high-quality evidence from 47 reviews and 8 studies across academic databases, a combined Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework is employed. Intrinsic psycho-behavioural drivers like norms, hedonic motivation, social influence, and technology awareness emerge as pivotal for DER adoption. While extrinsic factors like financial incentives, ownership models, and comfort consistently motivate uptake, certain DERs face barriers from technology attributes and costs. Analogous adoption strategies are identified for technology pairs exhibiting similar intrinsic factors, like photovoltaics with electric vehicles or home batteries. The findings guide formulating targeted policies and interventions, particularly for DERs sharing intrinsic adoption factors. Acknowledging these interdependent factors' roles, the study underscores developing equitable policies and regulations to promote DER adoption, ensure fair access, and foster societal acceptance for an effective energy transition.},

The articles relies on 23 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders of an stove replacement process and 23 participant observation exercises aimed at describing the heating practices of Temuco households. Based on this evidence, the paper reinforce the need to address different theoretical lenses in order to better account for the different scales and actors that constitute energy transitions.

The study uses some aspects of the innovation systems theory to try to understand the social origins of the narratives of resistance to technological change in a city where most homes use wood-burning stoves and cookers. Few studies have employed narratives to study urban energy transitions. A rich narrative about the complexity of technological change emerged from the interviews, offering valuable insights into energy transition research. The results show the relevance of early events in energy transitions in the development of these transitions. The narrative dichotomy between hero and horror stories emerges as a social mechanism capable of slowing the diffusion of emerging energy technologies. The findings of this study suggest that narratives of resistance to change constitute a critical issue that local governments must learn to manage in the transitions toward scenarios of greater urban sustainability.},

This study employs Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate smart city water management strategies. We use representative criteria, employ objective judgment, assign weights through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and score strategies based on meeting these criteria. We find that the ``Effectiveness and Risk Management'' criterion carries the highest weight (15.28%), underscoring its pivotal role in strategy evaluation and robustness. Medium-weight criteria include ``Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations'' (10.44%), ``Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation'' (10.10%), and ``Environmental Impact'' (9.84%) for ecological mitigation. ``Community Engagement and Public Acceptance'' (9.79%) recognizes involvement, while ``Scalability and Adaptability'' (9.35%) addresses changing conditions. ``Return on Investment'' (9.07%) and ``Regulatory and Policy Alignment'' (8.8%) balance financial and governance concerns. Two low-weight criteria, ``Data Reliability'' (8.78%) and ``Long-Term Sustainability'' (8.55%), stress data accuracy and sustainability. Highly weighted strategies like ``Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change'' and ``Smart Irrigation Systems'' are particularly effective in improving water management in smart cities. However, medium-weighted (e.g., ``Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness'', ``Policy and Regulation'', ``Rainwater Harvesting'', ``Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems'', ``Collaboration and Partnerships'', ``Graywater Recycling and Reuse'', and ``Distributed Water Infrastructure'') and low-weighted (e.g., ``Water Desalination'') strategies also contribute and can be combined with higher-ranked ones to create customized water management approaches for each smart city's unique context. This research is significant because it addresses urban water resource management complexity, offers a multi-criteria approach to enhance traditional single-focused methods, evaluates water strategies in smart cities comprehensively, and provides a criteria-weight-based resource allocation framework for sustainable decisions, boosting smart city resilience. Note that results may vary based on specific smart city needs and constraints. Future studies could explore factors like climate change on water management in smart cities and consider alternative MCDM methods like TOPSIS or ELECTRE for strategy evaluation.},

  abstract             = {This research is driven by the imperative for a comprehensive evaluation of hydrogen production technologies in Morocco, in response to the country's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and the need for sustainable energy solutions. Morocco possesses abundant renewable resources and relies on fossil fuel imports, making it essential to explore locally produced energy sources. The study addresses knowledge gaps by evaluating various hydrogen production technologies based on a range of criteria and sub-criteria specific to Morocco using the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP). Technology feasibility, economic viability, environmental impact, and social acceptance are identified as crucial criteria, with efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and community engagement being particularly critical. We identify that high-performing technologies, including T1 (Autothermal Reforming with Carbon Capture and Storage), stand out as highly effective and suitable for Moroccan hydrogen production. Moderate-performing technologies, such as T2 (photovoltaic), T3 (concentrated solar power), T6 (offshore floating photovoltaic), and T8 (hydrogen from hydro), show promise with room for improvement. Low-performing technologies, like T4 (onshore wind-driven), T5 (offshore wind-driven), T7 (hydrogen from marine energies), T9 (biomass gasification), T10 (geothermal-driven), and T11 (nuclear-driven), face challenges in meeting the criteria and may be less suitable for Moroccan hydrogen production. Stakeholder perspectives significantly influence technology performance and suitability, with the study underscoring the importance of renewable penetration scenarios, climate change adaptation, and regional suitability. The practical implications of this research include guiding decision-makers, enhancing energy independence, aligning with climate goals, and promoting efficient resource allocation. However, the study acknowledges limitations related to data accuracy, evolving technologies, and contextual factors. Future research directions could focus on long-term assessments, socio-economic and environmental trade-offs, and international collaboration in hydrogen technology transfer to contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.},

These companies are generally expected to be amongst the primary consumers of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. So far, however, fossil fuel companies have shown only moderate interest in CCS. Whilst a lot of potential operational barriers to CCS adoption have been identified in the literature, the value of CCS from a corporate strategy perspective has sometimes been assumed, but rarely explored. This paper asks the following question: What are the perceptions and positions of fossil fuel companies on CCS and how does this inform their decision making on CCS investment and advocacy? This paper addresses this issue by presenting the results of in-depth interviews with high-level CCS experts from major multinational oil and gas companies and major coal mining firms. The results indicate that CCS would require a significant change within the business strategy of fossil fuel companies. This is contrary to the common argument that CCS is attractive because the technology is regarded as not being very disruptive to the incumbent energy system as it leaves most of the existing infrastructure, actor constellations and institutions intact. While fossil fuel companies engage in CCS development, it is often to familiarise themselves with technologies that might have future value if markets for these technologies take off. In several cases, CCS engagement has served the strategic need to weaken the link between fossil fuel extraction and climate change, build up shareholder trust, and improve public perception. However, there is little evidence that these companies engage in CCS to develop a strategic insurance against climate policy risks to their core businesses. (C) 2017 The Authors.

  abstract             = {Various countries have pledged to carry out system-wide energy transitions to address climate change. This requires taking strategic decisions with long-term consequences under conditions of considerable uncertainty. For this reason, many actors in the energy sector develop model-based scenarios to guide debates and decision-making about plausible future energy systems. Besides being a decision support instrument for policy-makers, energy scenarios are widely recognized as a way of shaping the expectations of experts and of influencing energy policy more generally. However, relatively little is known about how energy scenarios shape preferences and expectations of the public. We use an explorative research design to assess the publics' expectations of future energy systems through an online survey among Swiss residents (N = 797). We identified four significantly different clusters of people with distinct expectations about the future energy system, each seeing different implications for the acceptability of energy policies and the compatibility with projections of techno-economic energy scenarios. Cluster 1 expects a system-wide energy transition towards renewable energy sources that is similar to the policy-relevant national energy scenario. Cluster 2 also expects an energy transition, but believes it will lead to a range of technical challenges, societal conflicts and controversies with neighboring countries. Cluster 3 is the only cluster not expecting significant changes in the future energy system and thus not anticipating an energy transition. Cluster 4's expectations are between cluster 1 and 2, but it anticipates a huge increase in per capita electricity demand while prices are expected to remain low. The study at hand offers some initial insights into the interdependencies between energy transition pathways outlined in techno-economic energy scenarios and the energy system expectations of the public. These insights are essential for gaining a better understanding of whether and how energy scenarios can contribute to informed public debates about energy futures and how desirable pathways towards them might look like.},

However, individual installations of PV systems are limited to property owners, excluding most tenants. This study focuses on amore inclusive type of PV, citizen- financed PV (CiFi PV) projects, and experimentally examines their social acceptance, distinguishing between socio-political and market acceptance. We studied design and framing of CiFi PV to make them appealing to tenants, while also considering the moderating role of individual predispositions. Empirically, we therefore relied on data from a survey experiment of 1674 tenants in Switzerland. The results show that projects with material reimbursement, a public or community provider, and proximity to local infrastructure are most likely to berated positively and chosen in a choice task. Ideological predispositions are strongly correlated with these indicators of socio-political acceptance. Conversely, the analyses also reveal that project design cannot explain concrete investment intentions. However, targeted communication can enhance the willingness to invest in CiFi PV among those with lower propensities to invest. Most importantly, a promising way to promote individual tenants' investment in renewable energy is to communicate about CiFi PV while emphasizing the collective dimension of the energy transition. This approach has the potential to increase investment intentions among politically right-leaning individuals, while it does not appear to significantly deter left-leaning and centrist individuals.},

In this context, photovoltaic solar power plants which produce ``green'' electrical power from solar radiation may contribute to the achievement of several of these goals. This article analyzes the extent to which the operation of on-grid solar power plants found in Burkina Faso, Madagascar, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa is a vector for sustainable development. Our results give us the opportunity to identify the role of governments in enhancing solar PV sustainability for poverty alleviation. Our methodology is both qualitative and quantitative. We pursued six case studies, performed a thorough grid analysis (seven categories of impacts analyzed at local, regional, national, and international levels), and defined a sustainability index specific to solar power plants. According to the sustainability model derived from our results based on contextual and structural variables, we found that, unless appropriate adjustments are made, grid-connected photovoltaic solar power plants have a limited impact on sustainable development and poverty abatement, especially at the local level.},

The survey analysis showed differences between the energy facilities with regard to the perceived impact on population health (combustion facilities were perceived more negatively) and landscape impact (wind energy facilities were perceived more negatively). All groups recognized the contribution of the RET facility to the economic development of the region. The effect of such local experiences on the overall evaluation of energy technologies was investigated using ordinal regression models. Personal experiences were found to be more meaningful predictors than socio-economic population characteristics or the proximity to the energy facility. In all investigated energy neighborhoods, the personal relationship of the participants to the landscape was a significant predictor of technology attitude. This points to the importance of investigating place attachment rather than pure visibility to understand the acceptability of land use for energy provision.},

The assessed social categories comprise impacts on human health, human rights infractions, working conditions, local job creation, quality of residential life, landscape quality. In order to cover this broad field of social impacts, four distinct social impact assessment methods were combined in a common social impact assessment framework. The application of the framework was demonstrated by means of the wind energy case study. The results are presented in the form of a social sustainability dashboard comprising 23 social impact indicators covering both global and local well-being impacts. The analysis showed that the life cycle material demand of offshore wind projects has larger impacts on global well-being than the onshore alternatives.

Our analysis investigates how the German building stock can be transformed into a nearly climate-neutral state by 2050. Using a stock modelling approach based on a typology of the German residential and non-residential building sector, we develop different visions (target states) of what a nearly climate-neutral building stock could look like. All developed target states achieve the overall goal of reducing the non-renewable primary energy demand in 2050 by at least 80%. In order to span a broad target corridor, the target states differ in the two central target dimensions: efficiency (reduction in final energy demand) and energy/technology supply mix (especially the herein contained share of renewable energies). Additionally, using the energy system model REMod-D, the interactions of the building stock with the energy system as a whole are investigated. We explore the differences between a target state focussing on efficiency measures and a target state where efficiency is partly compensated for by an increased use of renewable energies. We learn that from a private cost perspective no clear recommendation can be derived as to which target state should be given priority. This means that other criteria become more relevant, such as social acceptance regarding the different measures, or the challenges that arise from rolling out additional renewable energy capacity on top of what is necessary to achieve the climate goals in other sectors.},

  abstract  = {Energy production systems all over the world are in the early stages of a structural shift from below ground fossil fuels toward above ground energy flows i.e., solar, wind, biomass, and other forms of renewable energy. In other words, the energy transition implies a profound landscape transformation. Theories and practices in energy transition management are currently underpinned by `society-technology' or sociotechnical perspectives drawn from sustainability transition studies, which foreground political-economic rhythms and institutions that contribute to infrastructure lock-in and path dependence. The significance of these dominant views notwithstanding, they are inattentive to the challenges of landscape transformation and often relegate geographic space to a backdrop upon which sociotechnical transitions take place. The purpose of this paper is to foreground a `society-environment' or socioecological perspective of energy transition and, in so doing, begin to take seriously its spatial dimensions. Our approach brings the energy landscape concept into dialogue with ideas about the production of space and materiality in order to conceptualize the ways in which an energy transition is intertwined with material landscapes (e.g., landscape aesthetics and land-use patterns), territorial structures acting upon landscapes (e.g., land-use planning policy), and social values drawn from and embedded in those landscapes (e.g., emotional attachments and livelihood strategies). We apply this approach to an analysis of energy transitions on the British overseas territory of Bermuda from circa 1819 to present day. The research highlights the broader landscape transformations throughout the island's efforts to establish itself as a British Royal Navy coaling station and then as a tourist destination, and links these histories to the contemporary political ecological factors shaping renewable energy deployment on the island. Conceptually, the paper attends to the influence of society-environment relations in shaping the articulation of technological transitions in particular places and times. More specifically, the research identifies how land-use systems and landscape values contribute to `lock in' and `path dependency' that must be destabilized in order to facilitate energy transitions. Practically, the paper highlights the need to integrate energy planning with collaborative land-use planning as part of energy transition management.},

The study exploits the case of Manfredonia (a seaside town in southern Italy) to apply the new approach and investigates public attitudes and preferences towards the installation of offshore wind turbines in the area. The novelty of the proposed work is twofold: i) for the first time, a structured methodological approach is defined for the development of a hybrid extended-reality-based choice experiment; ii) the perception of the visual impact of offshore wind turbines is assessed in a touristic and historic city in southern Italy exploiting the proposed approach. Our findings underscore the importance of continuously monitoring public perceptions to maintain and promote support for sustainable energy solutions, particularly in relation to the perception of wind energy's visual impact. In particular, 65% of respondents express their worries about wind power plants impact on the landscape. Moreover, the positive coefficient of the visual impact (0.011) suggests a positive utility of respondents from a higher off-shore turbines' density and a marginal willingness to accept a compensation of about 13euro for the visual impact and of about 33euro for the distance from the shore. In this context the use of extended reality technology in choice experiment scenarios significantly improves the results and enhances the understanding of the landscape impact of offshore wind farms.},

  abstract             = {The shift to renewable energy is no longer an option but a critical need for addressing climate change. Nevertheless, it frequently culminates in exacerbating existing socioeconomic disparities, disproportionately affecting already vulnerable communities. This study examines the intersection of the circular economy (CE), the energy transition, and justice concerns through a literature review of 169 publications. By employing a comprehensive approach to analyse the environmental and social implications of renewable energy generation, distribution, and waste treatment, it advocates for circular justice as a framework to mitigate the disparities that arise from such a shift. The findings emphasise the necessity of an inclusive strategy that incorporates distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice into circular energy practices. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of developing evaluation tools that balance sustainability with social equity, thereby promoting a decarbonised future that is equitable for all, globally inclusive, and resilient. Policymakers and industry leaders should advocate for social frameworks that guarantee equitable participation and outcomes, moving beyond an exclusive focus on resource efficiency. Looking ahead, future research should concentrate on advancing technologies that support sustainable, inclusive energy transitions on a global scale. Aligning technological innovation with justice is essential to ensure that the transition to a carbon-free future benefits all, particularly those who have been historically marginalised.},

  abstract             = {This review advances energy sector understanding of consumer behaviour by synthesising existing research findings into a simple and accessible framework of influences on household adoption and rejection of energy technology. This understanding is crucial for energy transitions dependent on households using technology to support the energy system.A sample of energy research studies conducted in OECD countries and sourced using a systematised literature search identifies a broad range of influences on household adoption and rejection of energy technologies. Thematic analysis organises these influences into a simple and accessible framework comprising five psycho social categories: cognitive; social; affective; behavioural; and contextual. This contrasts starkly with the onedimensional consumer archetypes found to dominate energy sector thinking on household energy transitions, which lack any behavioural realism.Applying this framework identifies affective influences - uncertainty, control, trust - as a key difference between findings for rejection rather than adoption, and innovative rather than established technologies. Key differences are also observed in studies comparing early adopters and mainstream consumers, whose participation in the future energy system is crucial. A novel meta-regression application demonstrates the potential for this new framework to improve the behavioural realism of future energy transitions work by energy researchers, practitioners and policymakers.The results of this review have three main implications. 1. Using the framework to broaden the range of influences on household decisions will improve energy sector's ability to engage households in energy transitions. 2. Understanding mainstream consumer rejection of innovative technologies is key to accelerating household participation in energy systems. 3. A concerted effort is needed to engage households excluded from energy transition benefits by market-based approaches.},

  abstract  = {The conversion of textile water sludge (TWS) into solid recovered fuel (SRF) represents a promising approach to addressing environmental challenges, advancing waste-to-energy strategies, and promoting circular economy principles. This manuscript explores Taiwan's innovative efforts in SRF production from textile industry waste, highlighting its integration into industrial processes, regulatory frameworks, and global relevance. The study examines the key technological processes involved, including sorting, drying, and torrefaction, which enhance fuel properties such as calorific value and combustion efficiency. Challenges related to raw material availability, quality control, economic viability, and public perception are analyzed alongside potential solutions such as advanced processing technologies, government incentives, and industry collaboration. Comparisons with international practices reveal Taiwan's leadership in leveraging textile water sludge as a feedstock while identifying opportunities for further alignment with global standards and scalability. The environmental benefits of SRF, including waste reduction and greenhouse gas mitigation, are juxtaposed with risks like emissions control and high production costs. This comprehensive review underscores the potential of SRF production from textile water sludge as a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation, contributing to Taiwan's net-zero emissions goals and offering valuable insights for global adoption.},

The survey asked about changing to a new power provider, and about the installation of rooftop photovoltaic systems to identify the reasoning behind these choices. Additionally, future hypothetical energy scenarios were tested. The results show that a significant portion of the public make participatory decisions to gain an economic benefit, while another group appears curious about new technology, seeking information before reaching a decision in order to satisfy their curiosity. Both groups are larger than the third significant group, whose decision making is guided by environmental reasoning. The results also show that a large portion of the public are relatively conservative in their energy choices, leading to a very passive approach, while a small portion of respondents demonstrated a more active stance. These findings have ramifications for the future energy system and implications for energy policy development.},

This research investigates the potential role that new transportation options, namely flying vehicles, may play toward progressing the energy transition. As flying vehicles are a relatively new technology yet to penetrate the market, it is also prudent to consider the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) associated with their implementation, alongside the potential energy and environmental impacts. Through a review of ELSI and energy and environmental literature, we identify research gaps and identify how flying vehicles may impact upon the energy transition over time. Our research identifies several critical aspects of both ELSI and energy and environmental academia relevant to the future deployment of flying vehicles and describes a deployment timeline and the resultant societal outcomes. We find that flying vehicles could drive the energy transition and the hydrogen economy and that their widespread adoption could engender shared socio-environmental benefits. Our findings are relevant to transportation and environmental policymakers and identify critical considerations for the planned introduction of new, shared transportation options to the market, conducive to a sustainable energy transition.},

  abstract             = {As with many advanced economies, Japan is currently undergoing an energy transition, aiming to deploy the maximum amount of renewable energy in order to reduce reliance on energy imports from abroad. Ideally, this transition will not only increase energy security for Japan, but will also improve the living standards of its people and be representative of a `just' transition. In order to determine the nature of the Japanese energy transition, it is important to recognize the awareness of concepts such as the Just Transition, and to understand people's desires for the future. This research investigates the relationship between these factors, i.e., uncovering whether or not awareness of the Just Transition concept affects peoples desired outcomes, personal behaviors or pref-erences toward energy policies which engender a transition. Here we analyze a large sample survey (n = 6000) of the Japanese public to understand desires, behaviors and preferences, to attempt to extract policy implications and effective strategies to promote desirable behaviors which promote a Just Transition. Our results show that demographics impact upon Just Transition knowledge levels, and that these knowledge levels themselves then impact upon propensity to undertake desirable behaviors, or to allow for the deployment of conducive tech-nologies at the local or regional level. A greater level of understanding of the concept of a Just Transition, perhaps via targeted education may help to align people's behavior, desires and expectations toward the development of a fairer future energy system in Japan and more broadly for other advanced economies.},

We did this by analysing 156 ES-related articles from two Chinese mainstream newspapers, People's Daily and China Daily. Through investigating the framing and frequency of articles, the particular ES technology mentioned, and the stakeholders involved, we identify (1) a generally promising pathway of ES development due to its transformative role in China's low-carbon energy transition and its alignments with other national priorities and interests; (2) some uncertainties about ES development regarding local institutional inertia and how people interact with ES technologies, which could hinder an ES transition; and (3) domestic complexity and dynamics underpinning ES technologies, reflecting a supportive attitude of the Chinese government and a top-down governance system. Our findings help to uncover the unique socio-political environment around ES in China, how audiences are informed, and the support provided to stakeholders' strategies.},

  abstract             = {This paper describes a novel CO2 mitigation concept named ``Green Town''. ``Green Town'' is a fully integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) system applied at a town or city scale. It utilises air capture techniques to capture CO2 directly from atmosphere, as opposed to other CCS systems where CO2 is typically captured in flue gas streams pre- or post-combustion, then the captured CO2 is transported by pipeline and sequestered in offshore deep geological formations. The entire system is meant to be built within a community and in this way to inspire and interest the public and the younger generation regarding CCS technology. With enhanced public understanding of CO2 mitigation via CCS techniques it is therefore possible to engage the public in the early stage of CCS implementation. Technical details of the ``Green Town'' concept are given. To evaluate public acceptance of the ``Green Town'' concept, questionnaire surveys were designed and carried in Southampton, UK and Hamburg, Germany in August 2011. Total of 158 and 366 effective completed questionnaires were collected from these two cities respectively. Results from both surveys are presented. It is shown that generally there was a direct correlation between positive perception of CCS and positive perception of the ``Green Town'' idea. There was a stronger preference for the ``Green Town'' concept than for conventional CCS. This provides evidence that the idea of engaging the public through the ``Green Town'' concept could play an important role in laying a strong foundation for public interest in CCS projects. To explore the diversity of opinions on the ``Green Town'' idea and CCS between the two surveyed cities, a comparison of results from Southampton and Hamburg is also presented. The proposed ``Green Town'' concept of air capture in the community was shown to be a viably possible route for public engagement in this or other CCS projects. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Applying a sector-coupled energy system model, we examine the techno-economic viability, spatial and socio-economic considerations for blue and green hydrogen export in the form of ammonia by ship. Our results estimate the costs of low-carbon hydrogen to be 3.5-7.3\textexclamdowneuro{¿}{/}{k}g hydrogen. While Norway may be cost-competitive in blue hydrogen exports to the EU, its sustainability is limited by the reliance on natural gas and the nascent infrastructure for carbon transport and storage. For green hydrogen exports, Norway may leverage its strong relations with the EU, but is less cost-competitive than countries like Chile and Morocco, which benefit from cheaper solar power. For all scenarios, significant land use is needed to generate enough renewable energy. Developing a green hydrogen-based export market requires policy support and strategic investments in technology, infrastructure and stakeholder engagement, ensuring a more equitable distribution of renewable installations across Norway and national security in the north. Using carbon capture and storage technologies and offshore wind to decarbonise the offshore platforms is a win-win solution that would leave more electricity for developing new industries and demonstrate the economic viability of these technologies. Finally, for Norway to become a key hydrogen exporter to the EU will require a balanced approach that emphasises public acceptance and careful land use management to avoid costly consequences.},

To improve our understanding of support and opposition to wind energy development, we draw on concepts of energy democracy, distributive and procedural justice. Utilizing a factorial survey experiment, and latent class analysis to measure these concepts with a sample of 401 large-scale agricultural landowners, we identify three distinct groups of individuals with unique preferences that are grounded in how individuals view and support wind energy. Contrasting most respondents with moderate views on wind projects, we identify a distinct group of supportive landowners when community benefits are well defined. A third group is defined largely by opposition to wind energy whereby justice concerns are associated with distancing their land from the impacts of wind turbines. Our conclusions identify the value of careful and transparent project design in consultation with local communities and affected landowners to avoid opposition noted here and in previous studies.},

  abstract             = {During the last two decades, increasing use of full-coverage sonic mapping of the seafloor has made us more aware of the large and different number of seafloor processes and events bearing significant geohazard potential. This awareness combines with the increasing use of the seafloor for infrastructure and with the high density of population and settlement on the coast. Seafloor mapping is the first step in making a census of the geohazard-bearing features present in a given offshore area. It often provides the only tool for a comprehensive, although non-specific, seafloor geohazard assessment over large areas that are scarcely groundtruthed by acoustic prospection and seafloor sampling. However, the characterization of geohazard features on a morphological basis alone is limited, and more detailed investigations are needed to define the character and state of activity of potentially hazardous features. Such investigations include the use of deep-tow or autonomous platforms designed to acquire high-resolution data at depth as well as in situ measurements, both being very expensive activities not applicable over large areas. Thus seafloor mapping is often not only the first and the main but also the only tool for a comprehensive seafloor geohazard assessment. This special issue represents an example of the diversity of approaches to seafloor geohazard assessment and summarizes the present state of this discipline. Both the diverse technologies applied and the specific aims of offshore geohazard assessment brought different communities to deal with the study of seafloor processes and events from remarkably distinct viewpoints. We identified three end members in offshore geohazard assessment: (1) geohazard assessment ``sensu stricto'', (2) ``engineering'' geohazard assessment, (3) ``non-specific'' geohazard assessment. These are being conducted by industry, academia and public agencies in charge of civil protection and land-use planning and management. Understanding the needs and geohazard perception of the different groups is a necessary step for a profitable collaboration in such an interesting and rapidly developing field of marine geology.},

  abstract      = {The development of green technology in the world is progressing extremely rapidly. New possibilities for obtaining energy from renewable sources are constantly being sought and existing solutions are being improved. The multifaceted potential of the seas and oceans is an important aspect being taken into account in the development of the energy systems of a number of economies. One dimension of action in this area is the orientation towards offshore wind energy and the construction of offshore wind farms for this purpose. The purpose of this article is to analyse the importance of offshore wind farms in Poland's energy system and to assess public perception of the changes taking place in this dimension. The article is based on research and critical analysis of the available literature, legal regulations and industry reports, as well as on the results of our own surveys, the scientific findings of which were developed with the application of statistical instruments using PQstat software, ensuring the expected quality of results. The findings of the article indicate the significant importance of offshore wind farms in the creation of Poland's energy mix, with differing public attitudes towards their construction. Furthermore, the results of the research indicate a differentiated attitude of society towards the construction of offshore wind farms. The main motivation for majority support of the measure in question are economic reasons, which are connected with the expectation of a real price reduction per 1 kW of energy, as well as increased attractiveness of the region due to investments in this area. The main concern with the measure relates to environmental aspects, with concerns about the functioning of ecosystems in light of the construction and subsequent operation of wind farms. Negative public opinion is also signalled in relation to the potential risk of landscape change in a direction that is undesirable for the studied developed coastal tourist region in Poland.},

The procedure is spatially explicit, combining qualitative considerations of inhabitants and experts with quantitative data on energy potentials, and associating site selection with solar integration strategies. The outcome is a planning framework combining spatial areas with quality requirements for the implementation of solar power plants, thereby allowing for the envisioning of future scenarios.

  abstract  = {Along with public transport modification, building and consumer efficiency, renewable energy and bio-fuels, among other greenhouse gas mitigation strategies within the European Union (EU), Zero Emission Power utilising Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the key options to significantly reduce CO2 quickly as the world begins the transition away from fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions. Transporting CO2 from capture locations to storage sites will play an integral part in the implementation of this strategy, as geography, urbanism, regulation, regionalism and currently installed transport systems challenge the ability of the EU and its member states to store billions of tonnes of CO2 before the middle of this century. While the building of a CO2 transportation infrastructure is the primary subject of this paper, no discussion of transport can begin without at least a brief discussion of how and where CO2 will be safely and securely stored, and the identification and rationalization of the capture sites to the storage locations. Only after this exercise is complete can a transport infrastructure be devised that will safely deliver the captured CO2 for long-term storage and sequestration. The EU Zero Emissions Technology Platform SSI workgroup report used the latest data available from public sources to identify within each EU member state, both the largest point sources of CO2 emissions and the most likely storage locations. Early opportunities for success whereby relatively pure CO2 streams might be captured with minimal cost and complexity were also identified. Lastly, the concept of the EU Flagship programme was rationalized to storage locations. Recommendations were given for the assigned tasks. Within this context the SSI workgroup reviewed options that might afford member states the opportunity to begin the construction of transport systems and how an EU wide storage infrastructure might be devised and evolve, including efforts for the EU Flagship Programme, as well as a discussion on what such an infrastructure would likely not become. The report used as its primary analogue the history of the currently installed natural gas pipeline system in Northwest Europe. Transport considerations used estimations from energy modelling of how much CO2 might ultimately be stored by 2050 as a basis for the EU wide transport design. From that, geographical and urban considerations, physical movement and pressure limitations, CO2 quality variations, regulatory impediments, legal options, economic unknowns and value chains, pubic acceptance and education, along with verifiable, certifiable storage locations, both offshore and onshore were used to create an overall transport scenario that may prove a workable option in the coming decades.

  abstract  = {Energy transition depends not only on technological and economic changes but is also deeply embedded in the complex social and cultural factors that shape it. However, existing reviews on energy perceptions often focus on psychological, economic, or policy-driven approaches, overlooking the symbolic and discursive dimensions shaping public understanding and engagement. To address this gap, this literature review examines the role of Social Representations Theory (SRT) in understanding societal perspectives on energy transition. Using content analysis, we synthesize and critically assess how SRT has been applied to examine the shared values, beliefs, and experiences that influence societal responses to energy policies and projects. Our findings highlight the theory's potential to uncover how different groups construct and negotiate meanings around energy transition. While SRT-based studies emphasize the importance of social acceptance, we identify a key limitation: an overemphasis on community acceptance of renewable energy without sufficiently questioning the broader socio-economic paradigms driving the energy transition. This review underscores the need for a holistic approach that integrates social, cultural, and political dimensions to address the complexities of energy transition, moving beyond a technological substitution perspective. By positioning SRT as a valuable framework for understanding the social aspects of energy transition, this study contributes to advancing interdisciplinary discussions and calls for further research incorporating diverse geographic and socio-political contexts.},

Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are pivotal in this shift, blending efficient energy generation with architectural aesthetics. This review casts a spotlight on BIPV technologies, with a special emphasis on the less-explored semitransparent photovoltaics (PVs). These systems are not only energy generators but also natural light facilitators, setting them apart from their opaque PV counterparts. Advancements in both transparent and opaque PV, such as crystalline silicon, are discussed. However, the paper prioritizes semitransparent PV's unique benefits, including harmonious integration with building design and simultaneous energy and daylight management. An exhaustive examination of current literature and developments sketches BIPV's trajectory, highlighting applications, challenges, and technological strides. The narrative extols the aesthetic, financial, and efficiency merits of BIPV, particularly the semitransparent variants' blend of functionality and design. Performance optimization of BIPV systems is scrutinized across various environments and architectural styles. This meticulous discussion seeks to clarify the status quo, emerging research avenues, and future prospects of BIPV in fostering a greener energy transition. The review compares BIPV configurations with traditional solar PV systems, charting a path for enhanced energy production, cost efficiency, and aesthetic integration, with semitransparent PV as a key player. By exploring the interplay between architectural design, energy efficiency, and urban planning, this paper aims to solidify the groundwork for future research, reinforcing the sustainability narrative in urban energy infrastructure. This illustration presents a holistic view of the key challenges and barriers confronting the adoption of Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. It highlights technical limitations, economic considerations, policy and regulatory hurdles, and social acceptance issues, offering a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted obstacles in the path of BIPV integration.image},

  abstract             = {In the framework of carbon capture and utilization technologies and bio-energy transition, catalytic methanation seems to be an interesting pathway for production of synthetic methane for energy storage. This fuel has the main advantage to be already largely used in the current society, with the existence of an extensive transportation and storage infrastructure and a good social acceptance. The production of synthetic methane is under scrutiny by the scientific community. Innovative concepts such as sorption-enhanced methanation have been recently proposed, to improve the performance of catalytic methanation in terms of CH4 yield and cost-effectiveness of the process.In this work, the simulation of a sorption-enhanced methanation process in a dual interconnected fluidized bed system was carried out in ASPEN plus using the `fluid bed' block and using low-cost CaO (derived from lime-stone) as the sorbent for steam capture. The model consists of two bubbling fluidized beds operated, respectively, as methanator and regenerator under chemical looping conditions with the support of a Ni-based catalyst. The feeding gas, characterized by different concentrations of H2, CO2 and CO, enters the methanator where the catalytic hydrogenation reactions take place with the presence of CaO coming from the regenerator for the exploitation of sorption-enhanced methanation conditions. In the regenerator, the de-hydration reaction of the hydrated sorbent occurs. The optimal operating conditions were investigated in terms of gas feeding composition and recirculation of CaO between the methanator and the regenerator, to produce methane streams that are suitable for injection into the natural gas grid. Also, the effect on the system performance induced by metha-nation temperature was scrutinized.The results showed that the (unwanted) carbonation reaction of the CaO sorbent had a negative impact on methanation when a stoichiometric gas feeding was fed into the methanator. Conversely, with hydrogen-lean gas feeding, it was possible to find conditions suitable for direct injection of the outlet gas in the grid since the limited amount of H2 was properly balanced by CO2 capture by the sorbent. Moreover, a specific thermodynamic analysis highlighted the possibility of carbon formation induced by H2 sub-stoichiometric feeding and sorption -enhanced methanation conditions.},

  abstract        = {Many energy systems models have sought to develop pathways for deep decarbonization of the global energy system. Most often, these pathways minimize system costs or greenhouse gas emissions; with few exceptions, they ignore the constraints imposed by political, social, and economic factors that slow transition processes, making them prone to producing implausible decarbonization pathways. This paper integrates a key sociotechnical factor?social acceptance of low-carbon nuclear power?into an energy systems model to illustrate how it alters the optimal energy generation mix. The United States was chosen as the example, but the approach itself is designed to be general and applicable to any region of interest. An empirically grounded risk tolerance model is developed to characterize acceptance of nuclear power and estimate an upper-bound deployment limit for the technology. Illustrative scenarios are presented to improve our understanding of how the sociotechnical constraints that exist in the real world can alter deep decarbonization pathways. The cost-optimal generation portfolio to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 primarily relies on nuclear power. If risk tolerance concerns constrain nuclear deployment to socially acceptable levels, deep decarbonization scenarios are up to 11% more expensive than the reference scenario and require low-carbon options to be available and replace the reduced nuclear share. Results from this novel framework improve our representation of the effect of social acceptance on the adoption and diffusion of energy technologies. They also contribute to a growing literature that seeks to firmly embed the social sciences in climate and energy policy.},

The industry's modus operandi of presenting the public with 2D photos or 2D videos is inadequate as it does not resolve concerns about projects' visibility and noisiness, but rather per-petuates pre-existing erroneous beliefs. In the present study, we exposed respondents in Massachusetts to either photos, videos (2D, 360 degrees), or immersive cinematic virtual reality displays depicting a real wind turbine. We tracked attitude shifts in a pre-post survey about the respondents' views on wind energy, including their per-ceptions of the wind turbine and the expected impact of a hypothetical wind project in their community. Exposure to more immersive media resulted in more positive perceptions, as well as larger and more positive changes in support for wind projects. We also found large changes in expectations about the soundscape of wind turbines, including when volume levels were not controlled in a lab. These findings suggest that traditional media (2D photos, videos) may be counterproductive for informing the public about proposed wind projects. Immersive, multimodal media (VR, 360 degrees video) provide more accurate audiovisual information in a format that is easily understood by audiences less familiar with wind technology, leading to more positive attitudes toward wind projects.},

  abstract             = {This study provides a baseline for longitudinal studies of public acceptance along the US East Coast, where no utility-scale offshore wind farms have been developed yet. Using a visual-only discrete choice design, we evaluate the preferences of US East Coast residents for offshore wind farms. As the offshore wind industry in the US moves forward and wind technology evolves, some developers have revised their project designs to use larger turbines. We examine how a wind farm's distance from the shore, project size, and turbine size factor into viewers' visual perception and willingness to accept potential projects. In addition, we test whether the presence of birds in the images impacts viewers' preferences for proposed projects. We find that distance from shore is overwhelmingly the most important factor for social acceptance, followed by project size, while turbine size had an insignificant effect. For participants who viewed images with birds, distance was the only significant factor. Our results suggest that getting to 30 GW by 2030 will require greater attention to public attitudes toward the visual impacts of proposed projects with a focus on the distance from shore.},

  abstract  = {Given a myriad of challenges and technological advancement, the energy system has been constantly evolving and transforming, which requires compatible adjustments in energy policies. For regions with highly diverse energy sources, such as the United States, its important to not only analyze public perceptions of various energy sources, but also examine relative levels of support for energy transition policies. We examine public perceptions of two energy sources, coal and solar energy, as well as the public's support for energy transition policies that assist the transition from coal to renewable energy, specifically solar. To better understand how place influences attitudes and policies of coal and solar, we sampled respondents from three areas with varying ties to coal and solar: Saline County, IL, Houston, TX, and Burlington, VT. Our results suggest that one's place has an important effect in differentiating the public perceptions of renewable and nonrenewable energy and for support in an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. While residents of places with historical attachment to coal mining have positive attitudes toward coal, our data show that they have even more positive attitudes toward sustainable energy sources. These attitudes hold for future development and government assistance. If federal or state governments seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and consequently energy from coal, a major source of greenhouse gases), solar and other sustainable energy policies need to be targeted at places with historical ties to coal and other fossil fuels to ensure a procedurally just energy transition.},

The political challenge is to use dedicated funds and grants to move from the energy market to low-carbon technology. For sustainable development, governments must implement an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and socially acceptable policy. The risk of social acceptance plays a vital role in Poland, especially in Silesia, influencing the decarbonization process. The study's main objective was to identify socio-economic features that affect the assessment of the decarbonization process in Poland, assuming that respondents used central or local funds to carry out this process. The authors deepened the multidisciplinary aspect of the analysis of decarbonization, mainly pointing to social issues, which was presented in the article. The study was conducted using the ``snowball'' method on a group of 444 socially diverse people. They were based on non-parametric statistical methods: Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, which showed that the most effective factors in the decarbonization process are subsidies used by local governments. Moreover, it was found that people with higher education give less support to the centralization of funds for decarbonization, though they perceive that local funds provide a greater chance of success for decarbonization processes. This study fills the gap in social sciences.},

Considering that socio-economic gaps and inequalities may be widened by the energy transition, the ability to capture social impacts into models becomes crucial for decision-making aid. Because system dynamics (SD) models and feedback loops contrast the linearity of traditional models, they may capture non-linear effects of energy transitions on market dynamics, social, and environmental spheres. From this background, this work consists of a systematic literature review on SD energy systems models to identify: (1) if and how SD energy models incorporate social aspects and (2) if these metrics are suited to identify how renewable energy and low-carbon technologies contribute to a just energy transition. Papers included in the review were classified according to models' focus, geographical context, time horizon, and social aspects considered. Among the main findings, SD energy systems models have incorporated social dynamics into their structure, but it a limited way. Models mainly incorporate social aspects through population growth, GDP per capita, employment, social acceptability and perception, and energy access aspects.

Social and environmental fragilities of local communities, overlooked an exclusionary planning, have led to opposition movements against wind farm implementation. This study aims to assess how the arrival of wind power dialogues with the demands of the communities living in the projects' vicinities, as well as repercussions on institutional, socio-economic and environmental developments. A case study was conducted with regard to the Galinhos' community reaction to the arrival of wind power. First, public domain narratives were evaluated, in order to ascertain the different perceptions from the social actors involved in the process. Next, the community's vision was assessed regarding expectations and fears, created by the existence of the wind farm, before and after its implementation. The perception was that the wind farm did not change the population's socioeconomic conditions and environmental issues require appraisals by the accountable bodies. In this scenario, the materiality of the narrative that justifies wind farm expansion in the Brazilian northeast was assessed.},

This study aims to identify consumer preferences for carbon neutral generation technologies and link these preferences to respondents' characteristics, knowledge on nuclear energy and climate change, as well as concerns about these topics and political preferences. We estimate a latent class logit model on data from a stated choice experiment among 583 Dutch and Flemish respondents. Three classes could be distinguished in the sample. All classes value renewables over both other techniques; two classes are in favour of nuclear energy compared to fossil fuels with CCS and one class prefers both renewables and fossil fuels with CCS over nuclear energy. The probability to belong to a certain class differs across political preferences and concerns about nuclear energy, climate change or future generations. The results indicate that respondents are willing to pay more for renewable energy than for nuclear energy or fossil fuels with CCS, despite the realization of full decarbonization in each scenario.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

  abstract             = {The realization of a sustainable energy transition in Southeast Asia will require the overcoming of the current high reliance on fossil fuels in the energy mix and the steady and rapid growth in energy demand in the region. To achieve an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable energy transition in the region, it is vital to utilize all available renewable energy sources to the greatest extent possible. It is therefore essential to gain an understanding of how citizens in each country perceive the available renewables. However, the majority of existing literature in this region has been constrained by a narrow focus on a comparison between fossil and renewable energy. Furthermore, while previous research has predominantly concentrated on single-country analyses, there are significant implications that could be disseminated across ASEAN countries. In light of the aforementioned limitations of existing literature, this paper aims to make a contribution by undertaking a comparative analysis of public preferences for renewable energy sources in eight major urban areas in seven Southeast Asian countries. The findings of this study indicate that, while climate change (or global warming) is perceived as a significant issue, it is often regarded as a secondary concern compared to other environmental issues. This is despite the fact that many of these issues are closely interlinked with and would be exacerbated by climate change. Furthermore, the findings suggest that solar energy is the most preferred renewable source across all urban areas surveyed. In contrast, bioenergy (or biomass) is generally the least preferred source of energy in all cities. There is considerable variation in perceptions of wind, hydro, and geothermal energy, with a high degree of variability between and within countries. These similarities and differences in preferences for renewable energy sources appear to be associated with varying levels of knowledge or familiarity with each source, which is consistent with differing willingness to pay for each source. These findings highlight the necessity for policies that address this apparent lack of understanding of how the transition to a sustainable energy system and each renewable energy technology can help mitigate the impact of environmental problems highlighted in each society.},

Recognising that these sectors are traditionally siloed, we asked: who could be the actors in this emergent ecosystem? We respond to these questions by focusing on Hong Kong, a global financial centre envisaging to become an international centre of green finance, and conducting expert perception interviews to identify this normative actor/institution landscape of what can be called a fintech RE ecosystem. Our study found that this landscape will engage not only those in the three identified sectors but also require active involvement by the members of the investing public and regulators in government.},

In this transition, social conflict frequently occurs regarding disagreements over how, when and where energy should be produced, transformed or transported. Recent literature argues for the potential value of social conflict when conflict is used to draw lessons and improve policy and projects to fit with the concerns of stakeholders. However, research in which the actual positive repercussions of multiple social conflicts are evaluated on a systemic level is lacking. In this paper we aim to empirically investigate if and how social conflict leads to institutional change. Our first research question is how institutional change as a result of social conflict can be assessed. To answer this question, we develop a framework combining the Ecologies of Participation framework with institutional change literature to evaluate the value of social conflict on institutional change regarding the objects (the `what'), subjects (the `who'), and models (the `how') of participation. We apply this framework to the case of onshore wind energy in the Netherlands. Through a document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we answer the second research question: (how) did institutional change result from conflict occur for the Dutch transition to onshore wind energy between 2013 and 2022? We present our findings on which institutional changes occurred and discuss the dynamics allowing for or hindering institutional change. Our research contributes to a growing necessity to combine a systemic analysis of complex socio-technical processes with concrete measurements of change.},

Within this framework renewable energy transition is inevitable in search for a long-term solution to this growing energy need. However, several public oppositions are encountered during such transition processes. This study focuses on the wind energy - an important source of renewable energy - in case of Izmir which is the leading city in Turkey in terms of number of wind farms as well as intensive public oppositions. Study reveals social sensitivity areas of wind energy production regarding natural environment and economic life (agriculture, animal husbandry), sensory (effect on visual integrity, noise), health (effect on human health), technological (magnetic field and turbine number) issues. The study reveals individual and collective perceptions about the sensitivity areas, on the other hand, there is an opinion that does not consider the expressed issues as a problem. The findings show the validity of social sensitivity, but also raise the possibility of making sensitivity assessment based on the thought that there is no such thing or what he heard from others. According to the findings of the study, increasing number of wind farms within the context of Izmir creates a ``saturation'' among the society about wind energy. In this respect, ``minimum distance'' criteria should be determined for the wind farm site selection to the areas where nature and human activities take place. ``Cumulative effect'' caused by the concentration of wind farms in a certain area should also be taken into consideration. Finally, public participation during these processes and being informed is urgent.},

  abstract             = {Limiting climate heating while meeting basic needs for all necessitates large-scale deployment of renewable energy. Understanding the dynamics of mobilizing materials for the transition requires considering: 1) availability of resources in the environment and technosphere; 2) accessibility depending on resource quality and available technologies; 3) processability depending on energy availability, processing capacity, and impacts on planetary boundaries; and 4) operability depending on social acceptance and geopolitical agreements. Materials can be mobilized through four routes: 1) increasing primary production; 2) diverting existing primary production; 3) repurposing in -use stocks; and 4) re -mining wastes and emissions. The interplay of these enabling factors, material efficiency in design, and substitution with materials that are easier to mobilize determines the maximum possible rate of material mobilization and consequently the energy transition itself. This paper presents and discusses a framework to explore joint energy -material transformations, enabling to consider material aspects in transition modelling and guide technological developments.},

  abstract        = {Opposition to offshore wind energy can cause major delays in the deployment of this technology, possibly compromising ambitious national strategies for increasing the generation of electricity to meet the net zero emissions target. However, shifting the perspective to the technology in full - from manufacturing to siting - can shed light on competing pathways where opposition coexists with acceptance, and provides a fuller under-standing of place-based dependency dynamics. To apply this research agenda, this article presents a case study of France, where the first offshore wind farm is yet to be launched in 2025, in the midst of a growing controversy over the local impacts of the technology. However, France has also become a major manufacturing site for turbine and nacelle manufacturing, accounting for one-third of European industrial capacity.We use insights from social acceptance studies to offer an explanation for these contradictory paths. We study the role of scale in the social conflicts over offshore wind, showing the influence of wider place-based de-pendencies in the incentives hindrances to legitimacy for this technology. On the one side, local opponents to offshore wind farms deny their legitimacy on the grounds of their inadequacy within the inherited and centralized French energy system dominated by nuclear energy. Meanwhile, the development of manufacturing of offshore wind components is not questioned, and even benefits from a large support from local stakeholders. We then question the limits of current and future public engagement schemes in the context of a national energy system dominated by nuclear power.},

However, to date community acceptance research has concentrated on responses to actual proposals, seeking to explain local objections. `Upstream' research that investigates the `place-technology fit' of a potential renewable energy project before it is proposed is scarce, yet can inform technology deployment by taking local knowledge and preferences into account. We address this gap in a study conducted in Guernsey, Channel Islands. Data was collected using a survey (n = 468) co-designed with island policy makers presenting technical, economic and locational details of a potential offshore wind project. Results show that acceptance of the same project design differed significantly across alternative development locations. Regression analyses compared the roles of personal, context and project-related factors in explaining acceptance for each site. Support for using wind energy for local electricity supply was the most important predictor of acceptance, and this variable mediated the relationship between island energy security and community acceptance. We conclude that place matters for community acceptance and that security and autonomy are co-benefits of local renewable energy projects that deserve further research.},

The smart electricity grid is a key enabler of the energy transition. Its successful deployment is however jeopardized by social acceptance issues, such as concerns related to privacy and fairness. Social acceptance issues may be explained by value conflicts, i.e. the impossibility for a technological or regulatory design to simultaneously satisfy multiple societal expectations. Due to unsatisfied expectations concerning values, social discontent may arise. This paper identifies five groups of value conflicts in the smart electricity grid: consumer values versus competitiveness, IT enabled systems versus data protection, fair spatial distributions of energy systems versus system performance, market performance versus local trading, and individual access versus economies of scale. This is important for policy-makers and industry to increase the chances that the technology gains acceptance. As resolving value conflicts requires resources, this paper suggests three factors to prioritize their resolution: severity of resulting acceptance issues, resolvability of conflicts, and the level of resources required. The analysis shows that particularly the socio-economic disparities caused by the deployment of the smart electricity grid are alarming. Affordable policies are currently limited, but the impact in terms of social acceptance may be large.},

  abstract             = {Hydrogen and renewable ammonia are energy vectors that complement each other and will support the decarbonization of economic sectors where electricity is not a feasible solution. Ammonia is considered one of the hydrogen carriers that will facilitate connections between low-cost production areas far from centers of high demand. In recent years, one of the large-scale production routes for renewable ammonia that has gained attention is the production of ammonia from offshore wind energy and the conventional Haber-Bosch synthesis. However, there have been few published articles to date that address the long-term sustainable development of renewable ammonia from offshore wind energy. This study presents a literature review based on Scopus and Web of Science databases related to the production process of offshore wind energy ammonia. The main objective is to identify its strengths and challenges with the aim of achieving competitiveness. The review examines the state-ofthe-art technologies involved, production costs, potential environmental effects, and social acceptance of ammonia as an energy vector. The production process is completely examined, and the advantages and disadvantages of the process and production technologies are identified. In addition, a quantitative analysis is presented to highlight the improvements and challenges of offshore wind-powered ammonia in terms of production costs, energy consumption, efficiency, and CO2 emissions compared to fossil-based ammonia (SMR) and lowemission ammonia (SMR-CCS). Solid oxide electrolysis (SOEL) is recognized as the most promising technology for producing offshore wind energy ammonia, primarily due to its lower electricity consumption (higher efficiency), potential flexibility capabilities, and its ability to integrate 2.7 GJ/t NH3 of thermal energy from the Haber-Bosch synthesis. A comparative analysis in terms of energy consumption and efficiency, conducted in production plants with capacities ranging from 1 Mt/year to 10 Mt/year, reveals the potential for improvement that SOEL electrolysis has over low-temperature technologies. The high production cost of offshore wind energy ammonia, ranging from 600 USD/t NH3 to 1500 USD/t NH3 is identified as the main barrier to its deployment. However, a significant reduction in the capital cost of offshore wind energy and electrolyzers in the long term as well as enhancements in the operational flexibility of the Haber-Bosch synthesis could make it affordable. The question that arises is whether offshore wind-powered ammonia can be competitive in the future, given the estimated production cost of conventional low-emission ammonia (SMR-CCS) of 300 USD/t NH3 to 400 USD/t NH3.},

Phytomining is such green technology that uses the bioavailability of metals in the contaminated soils to remove the toxicity and gain the commercial interest of metals using hyperaccumulators. Due to the skyrocketing demand for nickel in clean energy transition and the depletion of high-grade deposits, nickel phytomining has been studied over the last few decades with successful field demonstrations in serpentine soil. In Sri Lanka, there are six nickel-enriched serpentinite deposits where little effort has been made to recover nickel from the soil. Moreover, the nickel toxicity has affected the local community and reduced the economic value of the lands. Thus, this paper assess the findings of global nickel phytomining studies in terms of influencing factors on phytomining, extraction methodologies, and the economical, social, and environmental benefits of nickel phytomining which help to explore the potential of implementing such method in Sri Lankan serpentinite deposits. Moreover, the findings of the recent phytomining studies with Ginigalpelessa serpentine soil have been evaluated to emphasize its potential in removing and recovering nickel from serpentine soil at local scale. By addressing technological challenges, extraction mechanics, and adhering to sustainability goals such as United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and Environmental, Social and Governance principles, this approach advocates for ethical and sustainable practices in serpentinite lands globally and locally, emphasizing responsible resource extraction for future demand.},

  abstract             = {The energy system of the European Union has suffered major changes in the recent years. High energy prices, increased energy security concerns and heavy reliance on gas, oil, and main combustibles coming from Russia have the three most important features of the EU energy sector in 2022. The European Commission has presented in the first part of 2022 the REPowerEU Plan which aims to implement measures to economise energy, generate clean energy, and diversify the origin of energy provisions and stocks. This program is supported by economic and legislative actions to shape the additional energy infrastructure and framework that Europe requires. This article focuses on the part related to the green energy transition of the REPowerEU, by investigating the perception of Romanian companies about favourably substituting fossil fuel to decrease emissions and reliance. This research examined the obstacles/challenges that have an impact on the adoption of renewable energy from the point of view of Romanian companies. An econometric model was conceived and it encompassed five variables that were analysed to see how they could impact the decision to accept and implement green energy in Romania. The article applied a quantitative study, with the primary data collected with a survey on managers in companies from five of the most energy intensive industries in Romania. The data was processed with the structural equation modelling (SEM) and the results revealed that market (economic), technological and administrative obstacles affect with a major impact the implementation of renewable energy technologies in Romania. Community (social) and organisational obstacles have been determined to influence with a medium effect on the deployment of renewable energy technologies in Romania. The outcomes of the article contribute to increasing awareness of the imperativeness of substituting fossil fuels by accelerating Romania's clean energy transition and considering the great potential the country has for making this switch.},

Few studies compare acceptance of multiple technologies or acceptance across sub-national regions. Due to differing levels of historical and current development of energy technologies, the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec provide a unique case for comparison. At the national level, results demonstrate strong support and high levels of familiarity for these renewable technologies, but limited belief they will lower greenhouse gas emissions. Lower levels of support for wind and hydro technologies were seen in provinces that recently experienced development. Using regression analysis, we found support for each of the technologies was influenced by a different set of factors. Important influencing factors included environmental and climate concern, familiarity with the technology, personal values, political affiliation, gender, age and education.},

Data sets that were obtained by this method were subjected to multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Results for both samples consistently indicate that people differentiate components located at the individual level (e.g., vegetarian food, avoid long flights, walking and cycling), components located at the societal level (e.g., taxes, regulations, urban planning), and components concerned with technological solutions (e.g., hydropower, wind farms, solar panels). These results give reason to assume that laypeople from Norway and Germany share a multifaceted understanding of energy transition, yet some differences between samples were present with regard to the substructure of the individual level category. Future research can build on the present results to explore the subjective meanings of these structures, possibly identifying barriers to public engagement with energy transition.},

  abstract             = {This study examines how people perceive possible pathways of a societal transition towards less carbon intensive means of energy production and use. Data were collected with questionnaires among samples of university students in Norway (N = 106) and Germany (N = 142). Participants selected from a set of 15 motives those which they considered to be strongly associated with each of 25 pathways, including examples such as public transportation and nuclear power. Participants also rated the effectiveness of each single pathway, that is, their perceived impact on climate change. Results indicate that the various pathways were associated with specific motives; for example, individual actions such as taking public transportation were closely associated with a self-restraint motive, pathways such as nuclear power and market strategies such as carbon offsets were closely associated with motives supporting free market and progress, and technological solutions such as solar panels and hydro power were associated with the motive for sufficient energy supply. The German and the Norwegian sample did not differ markedly in which pathways were associated with which motives; nor did effectiveness ratings for pathways differ between samples. Solar panels, wind farms, and hydropower were on average regarded as having a mitigating impact on climate change, whereas nuclear power was on average considered to have no mitigating impact. The findings are discussed in the context of public engagement with several of the suggested pathways, noting differences in perceptual patterns across samples.},

  abstract  = {Tidal energy is a renewable energy source that could be used to help mitigate climate change. Tidal energy technology is in the early stages of development and views towards this technology and energy source are not well understood. Through a representative mail survey of Washington State residents, we assessed attitudes and behaviors related to tidal energy, perceived benefits and risks, and climate change beliefs. Higher levels of perceived benefits and climate change beliefs were associated with increased acceptability of and support for tidal energy whereas greater perceived risks were associated with decreased acceptability and support (acceptability being an attitudinal construct, support a behavioral construct). Coastal residents reported higher levels of acceptability and support than non-coastal residents. Pulling from innovation theory, we show that levels of support depended upon the development lifecycle stage of the technology. Support declined once the project moved into the water from the lab, however, grid-connected pilot projects were more likely to be supported than those without grid-connection. Policies developed to encourage the development of tidal energy may be more accepted and supported if they include incentives for pilot phases with grid-connection.},

Through compiling and analyzing three qualitative datasets, we take a triangulated approach to better understand stakeholders' positive and negative views, concerns, and needs regarding tidal energy and if and how these are represented through print and online news sources. We analyzed comments submitted during the permitting process for the Admiralty Inlet Pilot Tidal Project, comments included as part of a tidal energy mail survey sent to Washington residents, and media articles about tidal energy. We found four types of concern themes within negative views towards tidal energy: environmental, social, economic, and technical. Shared concerns between organized stakeholder groups and resident stakeholders about the project and tidal energy in general included concerns related to the harm to marine life, the loss of native fishing rights, expensiveness of development, increased electricity costs, and the engineering challenge of developing tidal energy. Concerns unique to stakeholder groups for the project included threats from scaling up, issues related to public safety and security, damage to cables, inability to stop the turbine, harm to terrestrial flora, and sediment disruption and contamination. Positive views were commonly associated with the need to address environmental issues, technological innovation and leadership, desire to have a diverse energy portfolio, and economic benefits.},

However, it is expected that any transition to hydrogen at a meaningful scale or rate, will be dependent on the industry obtaining a social licence, underpinned by public acceptance. This study analyses responses from a public survey that asked 1,824 residents of South Australia and Victoria (Australia) to indicate how important six character-istics of a hydrogen industry would be in their decision to support the development of such an industry, namely: (1) safety; (2) climate change mitigation; (3) affordability; (4) reliability; (5) accessibility; and (6) job creation. Overall, safety was rated as the most important characteristic, followed by climate change mitigation and affordability. Fractional multinomial logit model estimates found socio-demographic (e.g. age, location) and attitudinal characteristics (e.g. concern about climate change, hydrogen knowledge) statistically significantly influenced individuals' importance ratings of hydrogen industry characteristics. This research indicates the trade-offs that individuals may-or may not be-willing to make in the transition to hydrogen energy. Such information can be used to align policy and investment decisions with public expectations for the further development of the hydrogen industry in Australia.},

This material dependence has, since 2019, initiated legislation and efforts to intensify mining within the EU. The Iberian Peninsula remains a principle target area for the EU's critical raw material (CRM) mining initiatives. This article explores the making of the ``Mina do Barroso'' (Barroso Mine) in northern Portugal, which threatens a ``Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System'' and will potentially become the largest open-pit lithium mine of Western Europe. This prospective mining project represents an investment and public funding opportunity for mining companies. The European Commission and the Portuguese government are applying increasing political pressures to establish this mine to make international decarbonization benchmarks through rapidly expanding electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage system (ESS). The Barroso agrarian communities are threatened with extensive socio-ecological impacts, leading locals, (some) climate activists and environmental organizations to reject this mining project. Company personnel and the Portuguese government are confronting growing opposition, blockades and a resolute ``Minas Nao!'' (No to Mines!). We explore the subtle efforts attempting to engineer the social acceptance of the Mina do Barroso, revealing the `slow' social warfare tactics employed by the company to infiltrate rural social bonds, exploit psycho-social vulnerabilities and attempt to disable anti-mining organizing and unity within the region. This article demonstrates the insidious social technologies of pacification employed to engineer extraction and assemble an open-pit lithium mine with severe socio-ecological impacts in northern Portugal.},

With this in mind, we analyze two engagement processes that led to the Block Island Wind Farm, the first operational offshore wind farm in the United States. Through semi-structured interviews we identify certain procedural techniques that allowed process leaders to first build public trust in themselves, then in the process, and ultimately in the outcome. This chain of trust was fostered through informal efforts of process leaders to meet stakeholder expectations concerning process leaders' ability to work for the public interest, provide meaningful engagement opportunities, and to produce non-discriminatory outcomes. This case study highlights the potential of such informal actions to meet stakeholder expectations and build trust, while also empirically demonstrating specific techniques that future process leaders could employ to increase stakeholder acceptance of RETs.},

  abstract             = {Cobalt (Co) is an essential metal for the development of energy-transition technologies, decarbonising transportation, achieving several sustainable development goals, and facilitating a future net zero transition. However, the supply of Co is prone to severe fluctuation, disruption, and price instabilities. This review aims to identify the future evolution of Co supply through technologically resilient and environmentally sustainable pathways. The work shows that advances in both primary and secondary sources, Co mining methods and recycling systems are yet to be fully optimised. Moreover, responsible sourcing from both large mines and small artisanal mines will be necessary for a resilient Co supply. Regulatory approaches may increase transparency, support local mining communities, and improve secondary Co recovery. Novel Co supply options, such as deep-sea mining and bio-mining of tailings, are associated with major techno-economic and environmental issues. However, a circular economy, keeping Co in the economic loop for as long as possible, is yet to be optimised at both regional and global scales. To achieve environmental sustainability of Co, economic incentives, regulatory push, and improved public perception are required to drive product innovation and design for circularity. Although the complexity of Co recycling, due to lack of standardisation of design and chemistry in batteries, is an impediment, a sustainable net zero transition using Co will only be possible if a reliable primary supply and a circular secondary supply are established.},

Focusing specifically on Energy Communities in Spain, issues such as the split-incentive problem in technology investments, market rules favouring large generators, and the imperative for improved coordination in the electricity market and network operations are identified as significant hurdles to further DR development. A balanced readiness level score of 7.25 is assessed for Spanish energy communities, composed of a 9 for the technological, a 7 for the regulatory and the acceptance, and a 5 for explicit and 7 for implicit market readiness level. The application of the balanced readiness level assessment methodology is novel to the energy industry and does not only prove the value it can create in this sector, but also provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders navigating the dynamic landscape of Demand Response for Spanish Energy Communities.},

Finally, on the social part, we consider local acceptance, visual and noise disturbance, and the potential of wind energy for creating jobs and improving farmers revenues. Compared to existing review articles, we gather, discuss and combine information on all of the above mentioned aspects. This is important as the combined consideration of these aspects is necessary for the sustainable implementation of wind energy projects. Additionally, we detail aspects that were insufficiently covered in the existing reviews such as generators technologies and the impact on farmers. This review can orientate policy makers and companies in their project development not only in France but also abroad, as several of the covered aspects (e.g. technical ones, several environmental ones) are also valid for other countries.},

These factors are mediated by affect and perceived effects, including perceived benefits, costs and risks. We tested the applicability of our model across three different energy technologies: hydrogen fuel stations, biofuel production plants and stationary battery storage facilities.

It also extends the literature, testing a universal model across different technologies and examining acceptance on both the local and the general level.

Participatory design processes can address the call for public participation and achieve qualitative aims stated in policy guidelines. However, todays permit procedures of local authorities focus on technical and economic factors, while other societal concerns seem to disappear in the development process of solar power plants (SPPs). In this study, we unravel the participatory design processes of three Dutch cases to explore their benefits and limitations, and implications for future policies. We find that local inhabitants have a strong position in these processes. Moreover, we find an imbalance of proposed measures materializing in the final design. Although there is attention for societal concerns beyond those of the local inhabitants, measures that address societal concerns are more frequently altered or removed. This is mainly due to economic factors and a conventional approach to SPP development as monofunctional landuse. Based on our research, we argue for redressing the balance between the concerns of local inhabitants, such as nuisance, and broader societal concerns, such as biodiversity and landscape quality.

  abstract             = {Based on data from a face-to-face survey of 2422 residents from urban Turkey, this paper presents an analysis of citizens' preferences in Turkey on nuclear and renewable energy sources. Findings indicate that opposition to nuclear power was strong, and only a small number of respondents endorsed it by listing it in their top two choices. Conversely, almost two-thirds of the sample endorsed investment in renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar), and only a small minority was opposed to it. Econometric analyses revealed that knowledge of the climate change problem was a common factor that explained endorsement of both nuclear and renewables. Yet, high levels of concern for the environment and a negative perception regarding its future differentiated the endorsers of renewables from those of nuclear energy. Endorsers of nuclear energy were found to be males who were knowledgeable about climate change and engaged in environmental issues, but less concerned about the environment, and optimistic about its future. Nuclear opponents, on the other hand, were found to be concerned about the environment, pessimistic about its future, and not fully relying on technology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {In the past, international business researchers have predominantly engaged their research upon multinational companies, mainly in the developed countries. Then over the years as the importance of SMEs grew in general, internationalization of SMEs grew as a topic as well, more in developed countries, but also in emerging markets or newly industrialized economies as well (Chiao et al., 2006). This abstract is part of a current research that analyzes the most significant successful factors and barriers for internationalization of SMEs in general, making a comparison between the ones from developed and developing countries. In the dissertation the author gives a detailed literature review of development of internationalization theories of SMEs throughout the years, while in this abstract, the authors provide short literature review with examples of some of the most significant factors and barriers for success. In addition to this as the dissertation is work in progress, the abstract concludes with discussion about the future development of the dissertation, with its methodology, data analysis and contributions to be gained by it. One of the most important factors for successful internationalization of small and medium sized companies if compared to multinational companies has been networking. Many scholars have researched the networking occurrence, that is, the inter-connection of the firm with its foreign partners, customers and suppliers, as the most significant success determinant in internationalization (Sekliuckiene et al 2016, Johanson & Vahlne 2009). Several opportunities are created with the international networking incremental for success: foreign market possibility identification, potential partners, reductions of foreignness and newness on the market, etc. Networking can have different forms, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, subcontracting, joint R&D, joint marketing activities, etc. (Shirec and Bradach, 2009). Incorporating the customers, suppliers, higher education institutions, research laboratories, public organizations, clusters, public groups and communities in the innovation process (called open innovation strategy) is another form of networking that can greatly assist the internationalization process (Sekliuckiene et al, 2016). Therefore, various forms of international networking exist and SMEs should be open minded and embrace as many forms as possible in order to successfully enter in foreign markets. Another significant factor of successful internationalization is outsourcing some of the activities, especially lately offshore outsourcing. Companies are struggling to gain innovative ideas and products in order to be able to compete against multinationals and low-priced competition coming from the emerging economies. (Tiwari et al., 2007). Especially for SMEs it is very difficult to be in line with the new trends and new technologies, because of several reasons, out of which most important are limited resources. SMEs have the opportunities with the globalization to hire companies internationally and engage them in some of their core activities, such as even R&D activities as many industrialized countries have shortages of skilled labor (Tiwari et al., 2007; Di Gregorio et al, 2009). Research done by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research upon 13295 German SMEs in 2003 confirms positive trends in almost one third of companies doing offshoring outsourcing (Kinkel at al, 2008). Therefore, offshore outsourcing should be evaluated as one of the valuable success factors for internationalization of SMEs. The literature review will continue with investigating further success factors such as entrepreneurial skills of the owners, training of people in international business, cultural closeness, international market monitoring, governmental funding programs and other assisting mechanisms, financial managerial skills, technology levels and investments in technology, niche markets specialization, imitating successful competition, etc. To continue with the search for all important factors of success, one needs to study not only the success positive factors, but also the difficulties when companies internationalize. Shortages of capital and limitations of banking support have been a major difficulty for going abroad, for all companies in general, but especially for small and medium sized enterprises. SMEs have been viewed as weak and insecure enterprises when compared to bigger companies and crediting organizations are not very willing to finance exporting activities of SMEs (Ruiz and Perez, 2017). Internationalization means confronting unknown markets, new competitors, unknown institutions and banks do not like to credit such uncertainties or usually would charge SMEs bigger interest rates if compared to MNEs (Ruiz and Perez, 2017; OECD, 2009). Therefore, lack of capital and shortages of working capital to finance exports has been one of the major challenge for internationalization of SMEs and SMEs should invest in better financial managerial knowledge and expertise in order to efficiently manage the scarce resources and become successful in the international markets. The next significant barrier that has emerged from current research is limited managerial internationalization knowledge (OECD, 2009). Managerial risk perceptions were one of the major reasons why companies did not go abroad. Human capital, the founders international background and global network and his/her entrepreneurial characteristics were biggest challenges for the success of the companies abroad (Filatotchev et al, 2009). Further research will analyze additional difficulties and barriers such as limited information to markets, the inability to contact potential overseas customers, difficulties of finding the right distribution channels and representation distributors, bureaucracy and local legislation, differences in product and service range, language barriers and cultural differences, lack of government incentives, etc. The methodology of the research will be a case study approach done upon 20-30 companies from 4 countries evenly distributed among countries. Two countries will be developed ones, that is Germany and Austria; and two countries will be developing ones, Serbia and North Macedonia. Interviews and questionnaires will try to depict the most significant success factors and difficulties of internationalization of SMEs and comparison between developing and developed countries will be searched for. SMEs will be selected that have over 5 years of experience in international markets and that successfully export or invest in 3 foreign markets. In addition to this data, the research will try to gain qualitative valuable information from interviews done with local experts in internationalization of SMEs, professors from local universities in this sector, public chiefs of export departments of local ministries or chambers of commerce, etc. After the analysis of both data, the author will try to gather all information in a valuable roadmap for successful internationalization of SMEs from both developed and developing countries. This roadmap will contribute to the academic knowledge of internationalization of SMEs, especially from developing countries. In addition, this research will be very significant for the SMEs that are speculating going abroad and of course to the governmental relevant institutions that aim to increase exports of local companies. Limitations could be limited number of countries and companies, coming all from the EU market. The author is considering to limit the research upon 2 industries, because differences among sectors have been evident. In addition, the author is considering to analyze factors and barriers at entrance in a foreign market, but also factors and barriers after 3 to 5 years of existence in the foreign markets, as differences have been evident here as well.},

There is an evolution from a purely technical focus to a greater focus on security, energy policy, climate change, and sustainability, reflecting a more holistic understanding of the role of nuclear energy. The 21st century has seen a resurgence of interest in nuclear energy, driven by concerns about climate change, although these topics are still relatively underrepresented in specialized literature. New areas of research are identified, such as integration with renewable energy and advanced applications. Research on public perception and social acceptance has gained sophistication. Surprisingly, an apparent lack of scientific interest in international collaboration is detected, despite its recognized importance in addressing global challenges and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current status and future trends in nuclear energy research and strategies.},

We apply this model in 31 European countries and, using hindcasting (1990-2019), quantify which societal factors improved the modelled pathways. We find that, if well-chosen and in most cases, incorporating societal factors can improve the hindcasting performance by up to 27% for modelled installed capacity of individual technologies. Public acceptance, investment risks and infrastructure lock-in contribute the most to model performance improvement. Our study paves the way to a systematic and objective selection of societal factors to be included in energy transition modelling.},

We find a fragmentation of the different strategic goals and approaches towards the market ramp-up of hydrogen technologies, which results from a deficient multilateral coordination within the federal system. Hydrogen coordination in Germany is constrained by party-political and territorial conflicts, but also by the interaction between intra- and intergovernmental dynamics. Thus, to prevent fragmentation of complex energy transition issues, such as hydrogen, regular coordination is required at both the intra- and intergovernmental levels. Given the exemplary nature of the German case, this analysis offers insights for the study of similar coordination challenges encountered in various federal and multi-level systems.},

  abstract             = {In the early 2010s, the French government officially launched its energy transition strategy dedicated to offshore renewable energy. Since 2011, the government has launched several calls for tender for the construction of commercial fixed offshore wind farms in the English Channel and off the Atlantic coast. In parallel, in the mid -2010s, the French State showed an interest in floating wind energy, with the planning of four pilot farms off the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coasts. Although the offshore wind energy sector is growing in Europe, floating offshore wind energy deployment is currently at an early stage. Floating offshore wind energy represents a major technological breakthrough, harnessing offshore energy resources that were as yet out of reach, but which are recognized as more abundant. In addition to strengthening France's strategic positioning among the pioneer countries in Europe for the development of increasingly mature technology, floating wind turbines present other assets: diversifying the French offshore renewable energy mix, improving an offshore sector that is, apparently, less controversial or disrupted than its bottom-fixed counterpart (in terms of cohabitation with other maritime uses and preservation of marine ecosystems). To better understand the socio-political impediments to the implementation of floating wind farms, we conducted a study of the local governance process around the implementation of one of the first floating offshore wind farms in France, in the Bay of Biscay. This study focuses on the analysis of perceptions of floating OWF impacts by decision-makers involved in the validation process of the Environmental Impact Assessment: how do these decision-makers perceive, value and relate to the marine ecosystem in the presence of a floating OWF? How do ecological factors shape decision-making, and what ecological factors are involved? The paper applies a network perspective in the analysis of the local marine social-ecological system (SES) to: identify nested social-ecological variables and key social-ecological networks influencing the licensing process in the floating OWF sector in France, 2) analyzing the power positions and the functioning of interactions through ethnographic observation of a political-administrative process, and prag-matically questioning the environmental governance of energy transition towards sustainability.},

Government agencies, NGOs, the private sector, and individual citizens play an important role in sustainable energy production. In Ghana, however, such collaboration is fragile in the fight against climate change. This current study seeks to re-examine the position or potential of network governance in Ghana's re-newable energy transition. The study adopted a qualitative approach and employed semi-structured interviews for data gathering. To explore network governance and low carbon transitions in Ghana, we examine key themes such as political environment and impact, actor cooperation and stakeholder interactions, financing and the tran-sition, market design and renewable energy integration, existing regulation and policy gaps for renewable energy transition, clean cooking accessibility, and affordability. The findings reveal the following; Lack of comprehensive consultations with relevant stakeholders leads to lower acceptance of the policy model and sometimes lack of policy awareness. Again, the unavailability and affordability of renewable energy technologies and access to credit facilities is a significant hurdle to long-term renewable transition. Ghana's renewable energy transitions require strong networking and interaction among the public, private, and non-governmental organizations. The study participants believe that the involvement of relevant energy experts and stakeholders devoid of any political biases is instrumental in accelerating renewable energy transitions, as emphasized in the proposed framework. The study recommends that the national renewable energy transition plan be evident to all stake-holders and political administrators. Such policy may encourage renewable energy investment through stable and fixed lending rates by the financial institutions and build a network with international organizations and cor-porations. These findings could serve as valuable information for the transition-based energy process, primarily aiming to govern sustainability changes through network governance.

The economic criterion then evaluated is the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the vehicle fleet, and the environmental criterion is the global warming potential (GWP) of a vehicle, taking into account the life cycle of the main technologies that compose it as well as the vehicle's operating phase. Here, coaches are analysed for the case study of Reunion Island. If the technical feasibility concludes that it is impossible to use a fleet entirely composed of electric vehicles, a fleet composed only of hydrogen vehicles would involve high TCO and GWP.

Using a policy mix perspective, this paper investigates innovation policy criteria from municipalities' locational factors, cooperation activities among stakeholders, and local knowledge about RES as antecedents to see how they leverage the development of local RES. We studied these antecedents at a local level by analyzing a sample of 727 middle and large German municipalities using instrumental variables regression. Our results indicate that policymakers should focus on building local knowledge related to RES for local actors and with enhancing public-private cooperation activities. However, we did not find that locational factors such as direct incentives and energy and emissions reductions have a direct impact on RES. We suggest that these locational factors can provide indirect support for RES, as a starting point for the implementation of other policy criteria which we investigated in our study. Our findings also indicate greater RES development potential when policymakers adopt a facilitator role and support local innovation networks among different actors rather than keeping RES development activities within the municipality itself. In such an innovation network, stakeholders from non-municipality public and private institutions offer additional support to develop a local RES.},

On average, introducing renewable energy improves social equity, any financial burden on electricity prices is born most by wealthier residents, not the poor, and towns are predisposed to benefit from renewables no matter the amount introduced. To improve these impacts, towns can increase the amount of solar they host, or they can adjust the amount of CO2 emissions, PM emissions, tax revenue, jobs gained, or unpopular renewable power plants in their town. However, preferences and demographics matter as well. Age, education, and local preferences in favor of employment and community development all significantly relate to equity potential outcomes. Policymakers should consider adjusting their local energy priorities using these levers if they hope to engineer a renewable energy transition that is both positive and popular for their constituents.},

This has helped to promote wind power as one of the most cost effective of the renewable technologies. Since the energy gain from off-shore power plants (OWEP) is higher as onshore, many offshore wind parks worldwide are projected. The other side of the medal is that the costs for inspections and maintenance offshore are much higher that for onshore plants. It has to be specified that sometimes, under harsh condition on the sea inspections are not practicable. For this reason it makes sense to develop monitoring systems in order to reduce the number of inspections, to identify damage in an early phase and to forecast the remaining life-time of OWEPs. This first part of the paper gives an overview on the importance of OWEPs. In the second part some suitable methods for monitoring different parts of OWEPs are mentioned. Finally the methods for online force identification, damage detection/localization and sensor fault identification accompanied by corresponding experiments will be presented.},

Poststratification weighting was applied to address sample representativeness. Our research revealed the public's preference for renewable energy, particularly solar and wind. Surprisingly, nationalist views did not significantly align with fossil fuel preferences, differentiating Serbia from Western European trends. Geopolitical considerations, such as Serbia's relationship with Russia, did not strongly influence public opinion. These findings underscore the importance of considering public preferences in shaping Serbia's energy policy, emphasizing the need for investment in renewables.

Although the United States is slow to progress, it is uniquely positioned to build on the existing knowledge that coastal European countries have applied for their own energy transitions. In this study, we analyze how federal and regional plans for expanding the OWE sector in the United States brought to the surface decade-long tensions related to multi-scale governance mismatches, jurisdictional conflicts, and unclear pathways for implementing national industrial policies. Drawing upon the European experience with OWE, we employ a dynamic multi-level perspective framework enriched by socio-ecological elements to examine the United States energy transition through its most promising technology. From our framework we identify six categories of OWE developments characterized by both unique and shared elements between the United States and European coastal countries. These elements are: (1) role of local communities, (2) governance structures, (3) multi-scale government interactions, (4) regional socioeconomic structures, (5) socio-ecological impacts, and (6) relationships with existing industries. Drawing upon our analysis, we identify and conceptually map four research areas in need of further development for the United States and the research community- (1) knowledge, (2) potential, (3) adaptation, and (4) learning. These insights provide critical information to ensure that the United States expansion into offshore energy generation is characterized by elements of justice, equity, and inclusive regional economic development.},

Recognizing the role that media play in this socio-technical process, we compare national news discourse on ES in Canada and the United Kingdom in an energy transition context. We combine the Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework with content analysis methods to evaluate 494 ES articles drawn from top-circulating national newspapers between 2008 and 2017. Comparing benefit/risk framing, narrative use, valence, and other reporting patterns, we consider how cross-national variations in media discourse reflect unique domestic contexts and priorities for ES adoption. We then examine how these discursive trends may drive or hinder ES adoption in the two countries and assess the broader role of news media in energy system change. We find that the case of ES demonstrates: (1) how energy innovations associated with socio-technical sustainability transitions are receiving increasing attention in national media outlets; (2) that techno-optimism is important for energy system change; and (3) that domestic contexts are critical for understanding media coverage of such novel technologies. These findings help to inform our understanding of public perceptions and adoption of ES in both countries, and thus support future research and public communication around ES as an energy transition technology.},

  abstract  = {Macroalgae (seaweed)-derived fuels are gaining increasing attention due to the high rate of seaweed growth, its lack of lignocellulose (which makes for energy-efficient processing), its lack of need for land or freshwater, and its potential suitability for commercial applications in the UK. However, while technological issues are progressively being solved, wider issues of stakeholder and public perception have largely been ignored, potentially hindering the development of this technology. This research fills this gap by conducting 19 interviews with stakeholders and 7 focus groups with members of the public to gain a deeper and broader understanding of perceptions of macroalgae-derived fuels. The results highlight the technological promise and confidence in the potential of macroalgae-derived fuels. However, they also emphasise conflicts and uncertainties among stakeholders (e.g. competition with other high-value products derived from macroalgae) and the general public (e.g. conflict with marine users). This paper provides insight into potential social resistance and key issues in the macroalgae-to-fuels supply chain. This information will enable two-way communication between everyone involved and increase the likelihood of successfully developing this supply chain. Key policy issues are discussed to facilitate this communication and encourage investment in the process.},

The objective of this research is to delve into the intricacies, opportunities, and challenges of steering Malaysia towards a greener future, with a particular focus on the shift from reliance on fossil fuels to the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass. Employing a mixed -method approach, this study synthesizes existing literature, policy documents, and case studies to examine the current state and historical context of energy use in Malaysia, analyze government initiatives and policy frameworks, explore technological advancements, and assess the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the energy transition. Results indicate that despite facing challenges such as financial investment, technological advancement, and public acceptance, collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, and communities have led to significant progress in promoting renewable energy. The paper concludes that Malaysia's energy transition represents a critical step towards achieving a balance between economic growth and environmental preservation, setting a precedent for sustainable development in the Southeast Asian region. This transition is not only essential for climate change mitigation but also presents opportunities for economic diversification, energy security, and social inclusivity. The study ultimately calls for continued innovation, supportive policies, and international cooperation to overcome remaining barriers and fully realize the potential of renewable energy in Malaysia.},

Therefore, it is crucial to understand positions and conflicts in society to achieve social acceptance. This paper analyses these positions using the example of implementing hydrogen and carbon capture and storage infrastructure to decarbonise the German energy system. The empirical basis of the study are explorative stakeholder interviews which were conducted with experts from politics, economics, civil society and science and analysed within a discursive and attitudinal framework using qualitative content analysis. These stakeholder positions are assumed to represent dominant social perceptions and reflect chances and risks for acceptance. The results indicate different positions while pursuing the common goal of addressing climate change. The general conflict concerns strategies towards a low-carbon society, especially the speed of phasing-out fossil energies. Regarding the combination of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage as instrument in the context of the energy transition, the stakeholder interviews indicate controversial as well as consensual perceptions. The assessments range from rejection to deeming it absolutely necessary. Controversial argumentations refer to security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. In contrast, consensus can be reached by balancing ecological and economic arguments, e.g. by linking hydrogen technologies with renewable and fossil energy sources or by limiting the use of carbon capture and storage only to certain applications (industry, bioenergy). In further decisions, this balancing of arguments combined with openness of technology, transparency of information and citizen participation need to be considered to achieve broad acceptance.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we pursue the hypothesis that acceptance of the energy transition is not merely determined by technology acceptance but also by the perception of socio-institutional stakeholders and the perception of fairness. We test an acceptance model which includes the following main predictors: attitudes towards the risks of the energy transition and attitudes towards the technology options such as wind power, photovoltaic systems or transmission lines. Additional influences are assumed to arise from the perception of regional added values and the trust in various socio-institutional stakeholders. Furthermore, we expect fairness to be a mediating variable for acceptance. In this paper we test the model empirically with a representative German sample (N = 2009) in a structural equation model (SEM) for the acceptance of onshore wind power. Moreover, we analyse whether differences in the factors are related to the German regions North, East, West and South since we assume regional landscapes, renewable energy sources and socio-political contexts to be important for acceptance. Results show evidence that perception of stakeholders and fairness is important for the regional acceptance. In addition, results show that, among the four regions, different factors are relevant for acceptance. Results are discussed and conclusions for governance are drawn.},

The results classify current renewable energy usage for electricity, heat and fuel production, existing renewable energy potentials, sound legal frameworks to support renewable energy, ongoing research and development activities and expertise in renewable energy conversion and storage as strengths. That fossil fuels still hold a significant share in gross inland energy consumption, energy-intensive industrial structures continue to be supported by fossil fuels and grid access is limited for renewables are identified as weaknesses. The main opportunities are green economies, climate change mitigation and technological innovations. Associated threats are demographic developments, lack of social acceptance and renewable energy resource volatility. We conclude that these regions' energy systems could potentially enable the realization of a strong integration of renewables and cover partially distributed, decentralized energy systems with embedded energy storage, and the application of smart technologies. Furthermore, we discover that the role of governments in guiding and managing regional energy transitions is highly important.},

We also tested if stability affects citizenship behaviors (e.g., signing petitions, supporting political candidates) towards energy technologies. As expected, acceptability judgements are less stable for novel (i.e., geothermal energy and CCS) than for established technologies (i.e., wind and nuclear energy). Moreover, the more ambivalent people felt towards a technology and the less an energy technology was personally important to them, the less stable their acceptability judgements. Yet, neither knowledge nor personal values were significantly related to stability of acceptability judgements. Interestingly, acceptability judgements were associated with citizenship behavior regardless of how stable acceptability judgements were. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

Through an international survey of energy-sector and sustainability professionals (n = 179), we investigated the desirable sustainability features for renewable hydrogen SCLs and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sustainability certification. Our mixed-method study revealed general accordance on the feasible inclusion of diverse sustainability criteria in SCLs, albeit with varying degrees of perceived essentiality. Within the confines of the data, some differences in viewpoints emerged based on respondents' geographical and supply chain locations, which were associated with the sharing of costs and benefits. Qualitatively, respondents found the idea of SCL harmonisation attractive but weighed this against the risks of duplication, complicated administrative procedures, and contradictory regulation. The implications of this research centre on the need for further studies to inform policy recommendations for an overarching SCL sustainability framework that embodies the principles of harmonisation in the context of multistakeholder governance.},

  abstract             = {The feasibility of the global energy transition may rest on the ability of nations to harness hydrogen's potential for cross-sectoral decarbonization. In countries historically reliant on natural gas for domestic heating and cooking such as the UK, hydrogen may prove critical to meeting net-zero targets and strengthening energy security. In response, the UK government is targeting industrial decarbonization via hydrogen, with parallel interest in deploying hydrogen-fueled appliances for businesses and homes. However, prospective hydrogen futures, and especially the domestic hydrogen transition, face multiple barriers which reflect the cross-sectoral dynamics of achieving economies of scale and social acceptance. Addressing these challenges calls for a deep understanding of socio-technical factors across different scales of the hydrogen economy. In response, this paper develops a socio-technical systems framework for overcoming barriers to the domestic transition, which is applied to the UK context. The paper demonstrates that future strategies should account for interactions between political, techno-economic, technical, market, and social dimensions of the hydrogen transition. In parallel to techno-economic feasibility, the right policies will be needed to create an even playing field for green hydrogen technologies, while also supporting stakeholder symbiosis and consumer buy-in. Future studies should grapple with how an effective repurposing of pipelines, policies, and public perceptions can be aligned to accelerate the development of the hydrogen economy, with maximum net benefits for society and the environment.},

In response, this study explores a wide spectrum of consumer responses towards the prospect of hydrogen homes. The proposed spectrum is conceptualised in terms of the `domestic hydrogen acceptance matrix', which is examined through a nationally representative online survey conducted in the United Kingdom. The results draw attention to the importance of interest and engagement in environmental issues, knowledge and awareness of renewable energy technologies, and early adoption potential, as key drivers of domestic hydrogen acceptance. Critically, strategic measures should be taken to convert hydrogen scepticism and pessimism into hope and optimism by recognising the multidimensional nature of consumer acceptance. To this end, resources should be dedicated towards increasing the observability and trialability of hydrogen homes in proximity to industrial clusters and hubs, where the stakes for consumer acceptance are highest. Progress towards realising a net-zero society can be supported by early stakeholder engagement with the domestic hydrogen acceptance matrix.},

The innovation-decision process for technologies composing the residential sector such as hydrogen-fuelled heating and cooking appliances is inherently governed by the complex interplay between perceptual, cognitive, and emotional factors. In response, this study responds to the call for an integrated research perspective to advance theoretical and empirical insights on consumer engagement in the domestic hydrogen transition. Drawing on online survey data collected in the United Kingdom, where a policy decision on `hydrogen homes' is set for 2026, this study systematically explores whether an integrated modelling approach supports higher levels of explanatory and predictive power. Leveraging the foundations of the unified theory of domestic hydrogen acceptance, the analysis suggests that production perceptions, public trust, perceived relative advantage, safety perceptions, knowledge and awareness, and positive emotions will shape consumer support for hydrogen homes. Conversely, perceived disruptive impacts, perceived socio-economic costs, financial perceptions, and negative emotions may impede the domestic hydrogen transition. Consumer acceptance stands to significantly shape deployment prospects for hydrogen boilers and hobs, which are perceived to be somewhat advantageous to natural gas appliances from a technological and safety perspective. The study attests to the predictive benefits of adopting an integrated theoretical perspective when modelling the early stages of the innovation-decision process, while acknowledging opportunities for leveraging innovative research approaches in the future. As national hydrogen economies gain traction, adopting a neuroscience-based approach may help deepen scientific understanding regarding the neural, psychological, and emotional signatures shaping consumer perspectives towards hydrogen homes.},

The limit to this raise is the price of implementing backstop technologies, which are technologies that can offer the same services as the mainstream technology (resource) for a higher cost and without the risk of depleting in the near future. In the traditional economics theory this idea highlighted the raising cost of raw materials. This paper aims to evaluate the development of offshore wind power generation technologies in Poland into a backstop technology for the mainstream, coal-based system. The method used was a comparative analysis of the most important factors influencing the costs of developing offshore wind farms. These factors are: planning practices, including legal regulations and environment protection laws, effective supply chains, choosing developers who can create projects and investors, who can implement them, developing land infrastructure, preparing the electrical grid operators to take in large amounts of energy produced in unstable quantities, and social acceptance. The evaluation was based on comparing the financial effectiveness of investment projects using LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity). The results show that offshore wind energy technology may allow for cheaper energy production, compared to the dominating coal-based technology, as early as the year 2030. Using favorable financing conditions (weighted average cost of capital at 4%), this could even be in 2025. This supports the thesis that offshore wind energy is the backstop technology for energy generation in Poland.},

  abstract             = {(1) Introduction: The European Union is a global leader in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The community's population has already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 22%, while the gross domestic product (GDP) in its member states increased by 58% between 1990 and 2017. The Union has shown that economic growth is possible in the link between politics, nature, and the citizens' eco-empathy. It has implications for both the European and global economy, infrastructure, food production, public health, and biodiversity, the formula for political stability. The hallmark of the European Union is the blending of politics, culture, and nature in its quest for climate neutrality. The community's horizon is a zero-emission economy by 2050. (2) Theoretical framework: The cognitive assumptions of the article are the following theses: 1. The Union strives to accelerate the transition process to a regenerative growth model using technologies for obtaining and distributing energy for individual and collective needs; 2. The Union and the European citizens want to hand over more to planet Earth than they take away from it, thus making progress toward keeping resource consumption within planetary limits. 3. The Union aims to reduce its consumption footprint and double the rate of applying closed-loop materials in the next decade. Finally, it fits in with the organization's policy projections. (3) Methodology and research results: Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in the research process. The literature has been analyzed on the subject and the applicable legal acts, making it possible to classify, generalize, describe, and systematize the facts collected during the research. A survey was conducted on 1106 students, and in-depth interviews were conducted with three energy experts: Krzysztof Tomaszewski (the University of Warsaw, researcher and lecturer on energy security issues), Dariusz Pachniewski (inventor in energy sector, businessman in hydrogen energy sector), and Tomoho Umeda (President of Polish Chamber of Commerce). The research aimed to identify the environmental and energy awareness, knowledge of renewable energy sources, and opinions of young Poles on their use in two areas: home and work. (4) Discussion: The reinforced narrative of creating a low-carbon society, a green economy, was adapted and evaluated for innovative individual and collective approaches in the research conducted in this paper. In the quantitative and qualitative samples, the assumptions made were double-checked. The former verified the students' views, while the latter, the experts' views. The procedure established the directions of knowledge evolution and approach to technologies and innovations among students of technical faculties related to the energy sector. There were existing individual and collective mental constructs on energy transition and climate neutrality identified. (5) Conclusions: The surveys conducted among university students of energy-related majors and specialties and experts revealed important information. First, it concerned the way knowledge is communicated and how it is interpreted; second, informing and implementing the European Union's climate policy; third, the creation of a low-carbon society; fourth, the perception of climate neutrality among young Poles, and finally, preferences in energy generation and use in homes and businesses.},

There is an apparent need to study its public acceptance and the general public's knowledge about it, especially in the context of more advanced inventions, such as smart grids, energy storage, or photovoltaic inverters. In this research, the results of a custom survey and those of several types of public social media datasets were processed to gain insights into the acceptance and awareness of these technologies. The second aim was to investigate technologies and related public opinions about manufacturers. One social media dataset was processed by a novel technology based on automatic data collection from popular social media sources, blogs, forums and public news. All the collected and anonymized data were restored in a custom-made data lake (unstructured database) and analyzed by a natural language processing (NLP) engine to extract the required information. The results showed that the Hungarian public's knowledge differs from the European reference values by a very high percentage. A further goal for new research in the investigated area will be to achieve a business intelligence rated system in order to predict future trends and events. Since different methods provide results from different viewpoints, the conclusion is that combined analyses have to be used for investigating popular topics related to energy, such as various technologies, issues related to energy transition, or even car sharing services for a sustainable future.},

  abstract      = {The global shift from conventional energy sources to sustainable alternatives has garnered significant attention, driven by the promise of economic benefits and environmental sustainability. The current study rigorously investigated the economic advantages and sustainability achieved from the transition of households in Mauritania from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to biogas utilization. The study constitutes a robust case study that centers on assessing the multifaceted impacts of this transition on household finances and overall quality of life in Mauritania. This case focuses on biogas technology adoption and its role as a competitor of LPG in Mauritania. The energy poverty portfolio of the nation has been explored and livestock waste generation and biogas production potential have been estimated at 2451 million cubic meters annually. Biogas production can fulfill 50% of the energy requirement for cooking purposes within the country. The community scale fixed-dome-type biogas digesters have been recommended for Mauritania by considering a community of 100 families. The calculated payback period for the community project is 74 months, and after the payback period, continuous monthly benefits of USD 1750 will be started. Livestock manure is directly utilized for farming practices in Mauritania, which produces 10.7 Gg of methane emissions per year. Biogas production is a clean and economically viable option for Mauritania, which can also be beneficial for reducing the methane emissions footprints of the livestock sector. This case study will prove as a vital project for other African nations if successfully implemented. Multiple recommendations for the policy-makers of Mauritania have also been formulated, like tariffs on biogas production facilities and swift financing schemes, which can further strengthen the biogas production on a national scale. International funders should also take part in coping with the energy demand of Mauritania and its mission to mitigate climate change rather than utilizing LPG on a national scale. Biogas production and utilization are much cheaper compared with the fluctuating prices of LPG and ensure health when cooking.},

In particular, we explore the role of local initiatives in securing ``socio-political space'' for the expansion of renewable energy (RE) and in embedding themselves in ``ecosystems'' of public and private institutions. German energy activists were more successful than their Japanese counterparts in expanding this space and creating positive feedback in part because they were able to build horizontal networks that anchored the energy transition firmly in local communities. Although problems with grid technology have led to retrenchment in both cases, Japanese activists' reliance on vertical networks has limited their ability to weather a backlash from national government and utility actors. Our study demonstrates the interaction of political, economic/technological, and legitimation paths to energy transition and highlights the importance of the latter two.},

  abstract             = {Meeting the United States' offshore renewable-energy goals for 2030 necessitates deploying approximately 9000 wind turbines along U.S. coastlines. Because siting bottom-mounted turbines in most nearshore coastal zones is either impractical or politically difficult, turbine developers are testing floating-platform turbine technologies for deeper waters. Deepwater, floating-platform turbines have the advantages of being sited in the highest quality winds farther offshore, movable if desired, and located beyond the horizon, out of sight from shore. This paper reports on conversations with 103 coastal stakeholders at community meetings regarding development and testing of floating turbines off the coast of Maine, U.S.A. Using naturalistic field methods, this essay reports common questions and concerns of commercial lobstermen, fishermen, and coastal civic leaders. Early-stage conversations suggest that once coastal community members understand the benefits and impacts of wind farm development on their quality of life, many share specific preferences for where offshore developments could be located. Citizens' remarks are sophisticated, nuanced, and innovative and include robust ideas for pairing turbine siting with fishery conservation. Findings imply that when looking to site offshore turbines in public, multiple-use ocean spaces, developers, planners, and coastal communities should engage early and often in two-way conversation rather than one-way outreach.

The assessment is made within the Dutch BioSolar Cells (BSCs) research programme on photosynthesis and its application in fuel production. Part of the programme is committed to societal debate by considering different options and uses of biosolar technology. To provide building blocks for these discussions, we conducted a comprehensive desk study supplemented with key expert interviews, and we identified and articulated the main drivers for the Dutch transition towards more sustainable energy supply. Next, these drivers were used to develop two futures: energy port and energy farm, representing institutional settings in which BSC technology could be implemented. Both represent fundamentally different types of innovation and are useful in assessing the effect of policies on future energy systems. Both scenarios were used in workshops with BSC researchers and policymakers. Their possible implications for the BSC programme itself, as well as the broader policy significance of the use of biosolar technologies in the Netherlands, are indicated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Achieving and implementing sustainable socio-technical transitions requires high levels of public understanding and acceptance across multiple sectors including energy, transport, heating, and other domains. However, the level of public understanding of even the most ``obvious'' high carbon sector, energy production, and of the surrounding class relations around its production and consumption, remains under-examined. A specific gap is how energy narratives diffuse through and are shaped by widely accessible popular sources. The extent that public understanding may be informed by how popular culture presents issues of energy, class and access, merits consideration, yet is underexplored. This article contributes to the emerging field of energy humanities by examining five stories from the popular BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, broadcast in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. It situates them in the time they were created and finds that the program provides representations of energy production and class and that these stories yield critique of political repression of subjugated peoples. However, Doctor Who ultimately does not convey a meaningful sense of endogenous social change as questions of justice are resolved by a saviour arriving from without. Our contention is that Doctor Who distils and represents via drama a degree of support for energy justice critique present in a particular place and time, the UK from the 1960s to the 1980s. Yet we also contend the energy justice critique apparent in Doctor Who is limited by several interlocking characteristics: the paternalistic rescue of victims of oppression matched by the uncritical validation of other and newer energy sources; therefore, the need for technological progress is endorsed. These limitations in normative energy justice appear in a programme viewed by millions and we contend these limitations prevailed in the wider culture which produced and watched it. Ultimately therefore interpretation of Doctor Who reflects on the theme of denialism, of the need for a just energy transition, which is conspicuously relevant today across multiple nations.},

However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors. Though most historical U.S. wind deployment has been confined to the temperate grassland biome in the nation's interior, regional expansion has implicated diverse land use and cover types. A large percentage of the typical wind plant footprint (similar to 96% to ¿ 99%) is not directly impacted by permanent physical infrastructure, allowing for multiple uses in the spaces between turbines. Surprisingly, turbines are commonly close to built structures. Moreover, rangeland and cropland have supported 93.4% of deployment, highlighting potential synergies with agricultural lands. Despite broadly decreasing capacity densities, offsetting technology improvements have stabilized power densities. Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation. Increased land-use and sustainability feedback in technology and plant design will be critical to sustainable management of wind power.},

Offshore renewable energy sources that harness wind, wave or tidal power are of major interest. Technological advances in these directions have not been matched by a clear understanding of the environmental impacts of the new devices, with most existing research concentrated on the impacts of offshore wind farms. Decisions often continue to be made without the support of a clear evidence base. Here we use an underwater tidal turbine, SeaGen, constructed and operated within the Strangford Lough marine protected area in Northern Ireland, as a case study to explore the potential impacts of the turbine as points of concern and argumentation in the decision-making processes. We use information obtained from official documents and one-to-one interviews with the main stakeholders. Our results demonstrate that during the construction and operation of the turbine the perceptions and views of different stakeholders sometimes disagreed but were often surprisingly similar in relation to both likelihood and intensity of the potential impacts of the turbine on marine biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in general. The overall consensus of views was refined and evolved under an adaptive management approach over the 10 years of the discussions and decision-making processes. The results are discussed in relation to cumulative gains in knowledge, future arrays of many underwater turbines and multiple use of oceans within social ecological systems to maintain the conservation of marine biodiversity.},

Performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant discrepancy in the levels of cyber risk perception between the system categories. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to develop statistical models, considering multiple independent variables, including perceived benefit, cyber security training, experience with cyber-attacks, and trust towards various stakeholders. Key findings revealed distinct results for IT and OT systems, and the regression models varied in both predictive power and significance of the independent variables. Perceived benefit positively predicts deck officers cyber risk perception for both IT and OT systems, while trust, which included measures of social trust and confidence, was not found to be significant. Cyber security training and experience with cyber-attacks only influence deck officers' perception of cyber risks related to operational technology. Practical implications of this work provide actionable recommendations for the maritime industry, including tailored risk communication tools, training programs, reporting systems, and holistic policies.},

This approach allows the analysis of pathways in between a cost-optimal system design and an equitable spatial distribution of renewable generation and battery storage capacities within the system. In addition, we investigate the optimal combination of short-and medium -term battery storage technologies, namely lithium-ion and redox flow batteries. Our results for the case of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a state in southern Germany, show that a central planning of renewable generation and storage capacity requirements results in lower levelized costs of electricity than a decentral design, as expected. However, pathways in between the two planning paradigms can lead to a more equitable inclusion of communities in the energy transition at reasonable cost increases, which might increase acceptance. The results of this study are of significance for policy-makers and local stakeholders, as they must address the conflicts that arise on a local level when expansion targets are planned centrally.},

  abstract             = {In many parts of the world, renewable energy is being considered as an alternative to supply electricity to communities in developing regions. However, even though various technologies are becoming available, there are several socio-environmental constraints that impinge on the viability of ocean energy conversion projects in isolated communities. By assessing environmental restrictions and socioeconomic attributes where electric power may be produced from the ocean can be useful in prioritizing the locations (especially those isolated) where this alternative is more viable. This paper examines socio-economic and environmental factors that may affect the introduction of ocean energy harvesting in areas currently without electricity. Our findings reveal that: a) in the coastal area of the state of Michoacan, southwest Mexico (at ¡ 20 km from the coast and ¡100 m.a.s.l.), 153 human settlements with over 4,000 inhabitants lack electric power; 16 of these settlements are indigenous; b) economic activities are mostly fisheries and ecotourism; yet, marginalizaion is very high in the area; c) there are four protected areas with nesting sites for several marine turtle species (greater black, hawksbill, leatherback, and green); the ``Deep Pacific Sea'' natural protected area harbors great biodiversity; and d) electric power may be produced from ocean energy, especially waves, currents and thermal gradients. The infrastructure for grid connection and technical and logistical support is limited, and the topography near the coast is complex. However, our results indicate that the coastal region of Michoacan, has promising sources of ocean energy, especially for isolated settlements with limited, or no, electricity supply. The results show that waves and thermal gradients are viable options for energy generation in the area studied. Considering socioeconomic conditions and environmental restrictions, our observations suggest that, in particular, ocean energy projects might be successfully implemented in two locations on the coast of Michoacan, Future on-site studies into the environmental impact, the percepction and acceptance of society towards the new technologies and economic costs are necessary before implementing these new technologies.

A global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy may mitigate climate change but may also undermine the capacity to achieve some or all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this study, we use an innovation systems approach to construct a comprehensive roadmap for solar and wind energy to anticipate and improve impacts of a transition to a low carbon future in a manner ensuring climate goals and SDGs are mutually reinforcing. Our multidisciplinary approach began with an assessment of public investments in renewable energy followed by a 2-day research prioritization workshop. Fifty-eight expert workshop participants identified six research themes that proactively address the environmental sustainability of renewable energy. Next, we identified linkages between the six research themes and all 17 SDGs. Finally, we conducted a scientiometric analysis to analyze the research maturity of these themes. The results of these efforts elucidated the limits of existing knowledge of renewable energy-SDG interactions, informing the development of a research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RD3) roadmap to a renewable energy future aligned with both climate goals and SDGs. The RD3 roadmap has been designed to systematically develop solutions for diverse actors and organizations. Overall, our findings confer a broad vision for a sustainable transition to renewables to minimize unintended environmental consequences while supporting interoperability among actors particularly poised to influence its magnitude and direction.},

  abstract      = {Despite recent technical advances, there is a risk that commercial-scale fusion will not play a substantial role in mitigating climate change or alleviating energy poverty due to a lack of public or community support, often referred to as a lack of a social license. This risk is not academic-other technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better ``communication'' or ``education,'' are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a longterm social license for fusion energy.},

RECs are majority owned by local members or shareholders who are authorized to share energy within the community, offering the potential to unlock private investment and financing for renewable energy sources and provide social benefits. However, successful implementation and a just energy transition requires the coupling of technological solutions with more open decision making, based on sound analysis, knowledge of engineering, spatial planning, and social science. We argue that financing and ownership models that address renewable energy complementarity, spatial organization of resource potential, demographics, pushback from incumbents, and inclusion of traditionally marginalized groups, are common issues across all Member States that are crucial for the transposition of RED II and a just energy transition. This paper highlights the benefits and challenges of widespread development of RECs, and using examples from the pending transposition process provides policy advice for effective implementation of the RED II with respect to RECs.},

A further commercial-scale CO2 Storage project has recently begun at In Salah, Algeria, and the Snohvit field, Barents Sea, is to begin injecting CO2 underground in late 2007 or early 2008. A monitored CO2-EOR project is underway at Weybum, Canada and research scale injection projects have been undertaken at Nagaoka (Japan), Frio (USA) and K12-B (offshore Netherlands). This demonstrates that CO2 can be successfully injected into underground storage reservoirs on a large scale. Natural analogues (natural fields Of CO2 and other buoyant fluids) demonstrate that under favourable conditions gases can be retained in the subsurface for millions of years. Although there is still very significant uncertainty in the actual figures, it appears that globally there is enough underground storage capacity for CO2 storage technology to make a significant impact on global emissions to the atmosphere. Some other major issues that must be addressed if this technology is to spread to power stations, and thus make a significant impact on global CO2 emissions, are the Cost Of CO2 capture, further demonstrations of safe and secure storage and public acceptance that long-term storage will be successful.},

Limiting the global mean temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C requires phasing out fossil fuel combustion almost entirely within the next three decades and replacing carbon-intensive technologies with low-carbon alternatives. Such socio-technical transitions are politically feasible only if public acceptance is sufficiently high. Here we investigate German citizens' views on the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) using a random forest (decision trees) classification and logistic regression model. We surveyed a demographically representative sample (N = 1,663) in 2021, finding that the majority of respondents (67%) approve of an ICEV phase-out by 2040 or hold a neutral stance. Acceptability is best predicted by the degree to which environmental problems are attributed to ICEVs, followed by respondents' willingness to abandon cars altogether or adopt electric vehicles (EVs). Our results further indicate that acceptability can be increased by providing people with information that present EVs in a more favourable, and ICEVs in a less favourable light. When the European Commission proposed to ban the sale of ICEVs by 2035, we conducted a follow-up survey to investigate whether this had influenced acceptability in Germany - with the result that it had not. In terms of concrete policies, pull measures such as public transport or electric vehicle purchase subsidies are preferred by the public over more restrictive policies such as taxes or bans. The findings of this study shed light on different dimensions of public opinion and their important implications for policymaking and the political feasibility of this socio-technical transition. Insights from this research can help policymakers in designing effective yet widely acceptable transport decarbonization policies.},

This technology is not only space saving but also reaches at a certain distance economic benefits compared to HVAC (High Voltage Alternating Current) transmission when it comes to installation cost and transmission losses. However, HVDC cables require a) quality assurance as verification / validation of product developments and their market introduction, ongoing tests for confirmation of proper manufacturing, installation and commissioning and b) ageing monitoring respectively a quick fault location detection during their service life. The quality acceptance tests are standardized (e.g. according IEC, IEEE) with mostly fixed limits at repetitive, comparable conditions whereas diagnostic onsite tests allow more interpretation and application of experiences according individual boundary conditions but also some room for the risk management of the grid operator. Typical testing aspects on cables cover: center dot HVDC withstand tests center dot Partial discharge (PD) measurements center dot Quick, precise fault localization with limited harm on defect for the following root cause analysis Even though HVDC power transmission is applied in market since 1950s, the dielectric testing of extruded HVDC cables in the factory and on site is still challenging considering the increasing voltage levels, increasing cable lengths and earth or even offshore installation. The (long-term) validation of insulation coordination requires high voltages for quality assurance tests which represent typical expectable stresses during service life like transient wave shape, partial discharge behavior and dielectric field stress in the insulation medium. This contribution will discuss some of the latest technical solutions to generate the required testing voltages for HVDC cables to comply with current standards. Considering the above mentioned facts, important aspects will be shown to explain economical, physical and technical challenges of dielectric testing of extruded HVDC cables during their entire life time.},

The article presents results from 2-day citizen juries held in four communities of Saskatchewan, Canada: Estevan, Swift Current, Regina, and Saskatoon in 2021/22 whose purpose was to determine if place attachment impacts future power production preferences and whether social learning can be achieved. Mixed research methods included a survey before and after the citizen juries and a qualitative analysis of the discussions and outputs.ResultsResearch results confirm that while there are common concerns across communities about unbiased information, transparent decision-making, justice/equity concerns, and people's involvement, community-imagined energy futures can be very divergent. Not only place-based attachment, the existent industry and infrastructure surrounding the community impact preferences but also openness to learning and group dynamics contribute. Focused deliberations on the complex problem of climate change advance social learning.The coal, oil, and gas community of Estevan supported coal, natural gas, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to a substantially larger extent than other communities, even increasing their preference for coal after the citizen jury. Saskatoon chose Small Modular Reactors (SMR) as their top choice, whereas Swift Current switched from preferring natural gas to solar and SMRs.ResultsResearch results confirm that while there are common concerns across communities about unbiased information, transparent decision-making, justice/equity concerns, and people's involvement, community-imagined energy futures can be very divergent.

The literature on CCS technology diffusion points to negative public perception of the technology as a barrier to imple-mentation, and the role of media in that framing. Yet, there remains a gap in the knowledge of media framing of a successful CCS project. This study analyzes the Saskatchewan case, the first successful commercial scale CCS technology deployment in the world and finds that the media framing of CCS technology in Saskatchewan applied a narrative/storytelling approach by deploying metaphors that connected to local values, beliefs, and norms. Also, it notes certain conditions in Saskatchewan made it possible for some frames to be advanced while others were minimized, discounted, or absent altogether in the discussion. Applying the Socio-Political Evalu-ation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework, the study highlights the role of authoritative voices, mostly within Saskatchewan's political system in reframing CCS technology from uncertainty and risk into opportunity; minimizing and sometimes discounting or ignoring the negative frames that have been identified in previous studies as a barrier. It concludes that in Saskatchewan there was a trade-off in framing, where opportunities to advance frames that emphasize how CCS technology can support long term low carbon energy transition and climate change mitigation were missed. This study adds to the literature in that it analyzes a successful case of CCS technology deployment.},

However, their development and integration are still in their early stages: many studies are performed without considering the overlapped social, economic, political, electrical, and information technology tasks simultaneously. This paper is the first to look at energy communities in their entirety, from the roles of the actors to the organisation, regulation, technical solution, and the market, to the use and business cases. The waterfall methodology was used throughout the work. The results show that energy communities can be viable by becoming reliable players so DSOs can better integrate the acquired flexibility and other services into their processes without compromising power supply. Their technical integration requires a coordinated operation and control of the entire power grid, including transmission and distribution, and the end-users, as proposed by the LINK holistic solution. The suggested fractal-based market structure, with the national, regional and local markets harmonised with the grid, facilitates the direct participation of small customers and distributed resources to the energy market. The results of this work may help policymakers, regulators, and industry representatives define new energy policies and processes related to research and development programs for implementing fully integrated renewable energy communities.},

The objective is to examine how institutional factors influence the share of renewable energy in the country, recognizing that energy transition hinges not only on socioeconomic and technological determinants but also on political economy and institutional variables. This paper proxies institutional quality by the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Regulatory Quality (REGQUAL), and Government Efficiency (GOV\_{E}{F}{F}), on South Africa's renewable energy share. We find that perceived institutional cleanliness, as measured by a higher CPI, positively affects the share of renewables. This can be attributed to the public's growing association of corruption with government activities and fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Additionally, improved REGQUAL fosters a healthier energy market but paradoxically results in a lower share of renewable energy in the short term. While contributing to stability, government effectiveness can hinder renewables' growth due to established industry interests and short-term priorities. The implications of these findings underscore the complex interplay of political and institutional dynamics in shaping South Africa's energy landscape. This research highlights the need for integrated policies addressing environmental and socioeconomic objectives.},

  abstract             = {Citizens are the target group of sustainability policies, and their acceptance and subsequent behavioral change are key in transition processes. But what drives citizens to accept new instruments that will be added to a preexisting instrument mix? To answer this question, we suggest an innovative combination of sustainability transitions and social acceptance research, and examine the case of Swiss energy turnaround. We rely on data from a representative sample of the Swiss resident population. By estimating logistic multi-response models, we disentangle individual and context-related factors that drive instrument preferences in a instrument mix situation. We conclude that it is mainly individual factors (values in favor of nuclear phasing out and climate mitigation) that positively impact the acceptance of instruments that promote the larger energy transitions through renewables. Additionally, the self-contribution of citizens (energy pro-sumers) seems to shape preferences more than current policies of their own jurisdiction.},

France, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Romania support nuclear plants as contributing to carbon neutrality, while Germany, Spain, Denmark, Portugal, and Luxembourg oppose (Reuters, 2023). The study ``Between Stability and Sustainability: Nuclear Energy in Romania's Energy Mix'' concludes that Romania can benefit from its nuclear facilities and domestic uranium resources, to consolidate its sustainable energy policy. However, new nuclear capacities may pose considerable challenges, especially in terms of costs (Dumitrescu, 2023). Unfortunately, rising costs per megawatt hour are the very reason why NuScale, the operator chosen by Romania to deploy six small nuclear reactors by 2027, canceled their US-based flagship Carbon Free Power Project (Fortune, 2023). Nevertheless, the setback in the home country did not prevent Romanian authorities from licensing the NuScale small modular reactor power plant in Doicesti (World Nuclear News, 2023). The watchdog Greenpeace warned about the project's high costs and the long construction timeframe. It was also emphasized that Romania adopted a technology that had never been tested before. In addition, the location of the new plant had been decided without prior consultation from the local community, claimed the NGO (Greenpeace, 2022). According to the journalists, the local community has been divided between those who want new jobs and people afraid of radiations. Reporters made a parallel between the current situation and a formerly failed Chevron shale gas production investment, due to the strong opposition to fracking (Hotnews, 2024). This paper attempts to determine how a newcomer to the nuclear energy market, with a significant approval setback in its home country, using untested technology, can complete the construction of six small modular reactors in Romania, integrate those into the national grid and win over the public acceptance by 2030.},

  abstract             = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to reduce CO2 emissions from power and industry. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, further reduction of the cost to implement the full technology chain is necessary. Full chain CCS cost depends on multiple technological, market, and societal factors. Therefore, case-specific cost analysis is important. This study estimates the CCS cost in Japan, which can be considered as a case study for specific countries where offshore sites are more suitable for CO2 storage than onshore sites regarding geological reasons and barrier reduction of public/political acceptance. With the phasedown of unabated coal power, retrofitting amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture system is a realistic way for pulverized coal-fired power plants. Capture cost was determined by the process simulation of coal-fired power plant retrofits. Current political realities in Japan suggest that CO2 transport will be done by ship. Transport cost was estimated via a bottom-up analysis of each sub-process. Injection and monitoring cost was based on the values reported by the Tomakomai demonstration project, which are applicable to onshore injection into an offshore storage site. We find the full chain CCS cost to be 99-111 USD/t-CO2. Though changing the solution in the CO2 capture process from monoethanolamine to the blend of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine reduces the regeneration energy by 0.85 GJ/t-CO2, the CCS cost was only reduced by similar to 9 USD/t-CO2. Likewise, even when the regeneration energy was reduced to 2.0 GJ/t-CO2 using a hypothetical amine solution embedded in a highly optimized PCC system, the CCS cost was still similar to 93 USD/t-CO2. Considering that capital expenditure accounts for similar to 65% of capture cost, downsizing capture facilities may provide further cost reduction. Since transport and storage costs were roughly equivalent to capture costs, full chain CCS implementation is likely necessary to reduce costs through learning-by-doing, scale-out, and market effects.},

This study examines the role of MDFs in determining households' intention to embrace SPTs within an integrated ecological perception framework, which focuses on the ecological advantages of SPTs, openness to innovation, and advantages to the built environment. We used the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling to analyze the Likert-scale data gathered from 311 respondents to reveal that the fixed cost of SPTs discourages households from embracing them. The advantages to the built environment, openness to innovation, and ecological advantages encourage households to accept SPTs, but only in urban districts and the entire dataset while portraying a neutral role in rural districts. Thus, urban and rural districts differ in impacting households' adoption of SPTs. The social disposition of SPTs is the key driving force, while the advantages to the built environment play a less critical role. This study suggests propagating awareness among rural households about ecologically friendly dimensions of SPTs to uplift rural energy access, cultivating universal access to affordable and clean energy (SDG-7) and combating climatic disruptions (SDG-13).},

A complicating factor in this respect is the uncertainty surrounding new technology and the lack of related historical data (notably seismic records). We support the opinion of Boulder and Lofstedt (2024) that to effectively address this problem, we should avoid a dichotomy of acceptable versus unacceptable risks, as stimulated by the use of the precautionary principle. Instead, we should use a Tolerability Of Risk (TOR) approach with the As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) principle as key element.},

Although the results suggest that all RE technologies are widely accepted, they also highlight a preference for photovoltaic energy and for medium-sized plants in sites with low natural value.

This study investigates the dynamics and projected growth of RES in West Pomerania, Poland, a region with significant potential due to its geographical characteristics and supportive policy frameworks. Historical data from 2010 to 2023 were used to perform a time series analysis that evaluated the annual growth rate (AGR) of various RES technologies, including wind, solar, biomass, and biogas. The analysis revealed a consistent upward trend in RES capacity, particularly in wind and solar energy, demonstrating effective resource mobilisation in the region. Subsequently, a forecasting model was employed to project the growth of the RES capacity through 2033 based on historical trends and technological advancements. The results indicate significant anticipated increases in RES capacity, highlighting West Pomerania's potential to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. This growth supports increased energy security and environmental sustainability. This study addresses a notable gap in the literature by linking regional renewable energy development with broader policy frameworks, such as the European Green Deal, and exploring the specific challenges of grid integration and economic disparities in the context of local energy transitions. These findings highlight the importance of sustained investment and policy support to scale renewable infrastructure while aligning regional initiatives with international sustainability goals. By bridging this gap, this study concludes that the West Pomerania strategy can serve as a model for other regions aiming to enhance their renewable energy portfolios and effectively meet the climate goals of the EU.},

Only 48.9% of the articles in the literature review included a theoretical underpinning, or discussed an existing framework. Of these, 42.2% were theories or frameworks that were only featured in a single paper, highlighting the need for theoretical focus within this field of study. For those theories and frameworks that had been explored in multiple articles, these theories and frameworks were grouped into nine overarching concepts: acceptance, place attachment, justice, economics, technology innovation systems, environmental assessment, strategic environmental assessment, adaptive management, and marine spatial planning (MSP). Each of these concepts were expounded on to discuss the limitations of the current research on the concept and identify promising avenues for future research. In comparing the functionality of these concepts, most have a realized capacity for understanding costs and benefits, risk and uncertainty. However less than half have a realized capacity for managing costs and benefits and risk, while less than a third have a realized capacity for managing uncertainty. This paper offers a summary table of existing theories and frameworks that could be used as a launching point for detailing a research agenda for more systematically exploring theories and frameworks for human dimensions of tidal energy.},

Of all the interviewees, 73.6 percent agreed with and 12.2 percent opposed the fuel transition, respectively, agreement being about six times greater than opposition. The model secured statistical significance and various findings emerged. For example, people living in the Seoul Metropolitan area, people who use electricity for heating, people with a low education level, young people, and high-income people were more receptive of the fuel transition than others. Moreover, several implications arose from the survey in terms of enhancing acceptance.},

Among these, onshore wind has often been contested. Taking the case of Norway where opposition to onshore wind has grown, this article evaluates how different production, financial, and end-use schemes can mitigate opposition. One factor stands out: that the wind farm is used not only to produce emission-free hydrogen but that this hydrogen is also sold locally to decarbonize sectors such as transport and industry. In other words, hydrogen on its own will not ``save'' onshore wind from contestation, but hydrogen with a local purpose will render citizens more supportive of these projects, even when situated in their own municipality. This effect is particularly strong among younger and more educated citizens. However, it transcends the rural-urban divide which often structures attitudes towards onshore wind projects.},

Transitioning to electricity systems that are considered acceptable by the public requires that the public's preferences be taken into account. In this study, we investigate the type of energy technology portfolio that people prefer for Switzerland, and why they prefer it, when they are faced with two realistic constraints: (i) the limited domestic potential for the expansion of power plants and (ii) the requirement to not dismantle existing infrastructure. We find that the affect evoked by particular energy technologies is consistently the most important driver of the proportion of those technologies included in an energy portfolio. The regression models for the investigated technologies explain between 14% and 54% of the variance, providing strong support for the affect heuristic. We further find that concerns regarding environmental impacts, costs or climate change play an additional role for portfolio preferences. This is reflected in four different clusters we identified for the German-speaking Swiss population who potentially hold opposing views as to what they consider the best electricity mix. For policymakers, our findings suggest that positive affective reactions towards energy technologies are necessary, although concerns must also be considered if the implementation is to be widely accepted.},

In this context, governmental agencies and other institutions have attempted to communicate the implications of (domestic) electricity systems through the use of web-based and interactive decision support systems (DSSs). Studies show that, when no additional information is provided, preferences concerning the future electricity mix are mainly driven by the affective reactions that energy technologies evoke. A question remains, however, regarding how people engage with the information provided in a DSS, as well as whether such information is influential in terms of shaping people's choices. We asked our participants to build an electricity portfolio using a DSS, which modeled the Swiss electricity system. The participants' political orientation and their affective reactions to different energy technologies guided their information search, as well as the choice of energy technologies within their portfolio. The attention paid to the information provided was not directly related to the participants' portfolio choices. The selective processing of information, which was based on the participants' prior attitudes, suggests that they target information they are already familiar with in the DSS. However, this also illustrates a caveat previously identified in motivated political reasoning, since selective information processing, together with the tendency to disconfirm information that is incongruent with prior beliefs, can lead to the polarization of previously held views. As the information provided through the DSS we tested was unable to change the participants' affective-cognitive evaluation of energy technologies, its use should be carefully considered in light of the possible effects of consolidating existing beliefs.},

It does so via survey data collected from almost 2000 respondents during a Danish near-shore wind farm tender. Judging by this data, local PRs are positive towards the planned local RETs, while SHOs are less so. This emphasizes that potential RET project stakeholders and stakeholder groups may have very different RET project perceptions and opinions. The planned RET projects were subject to widespread critique in the public and political RET project related debate, but the documented PR RET project support was rather silent support. This is a noteworthy inconsistency calling for further research. Drawing upon research insights from the interdisciplinary socially focused energy transitions body of literature, the paper suggests that particular uses of and attachments to particular places may inform stakeholder perceptions of RET related local change. The research findings have significant implications for RET planning, practice and policy more broadly.},

Understanding who the stakeholders are and how they are engaged in the process is necessary for improving the responsible development of renewable energy technologies. Using structured community interviews and in-depth ethnographic research (semistructured interviews, informal interviews, observations, and document review), we identified and characterized the most salient stakeholders associated with tidal power development in Maine and documented stakeholder perceptions of developer engagement strategies. Stakeholder characterization was facilitated using a framework by Mitchell et al. (The Academy of Management Review 22: 853-886, 1997) that characterizes salient stakeholders using attributes of power, urgency, and legitimacy. Key stakeholders identified include fishermen, community members, tribes, regulators, developers, and scientists. Fishermen and regulators are definitive stakeholders, with legitimacy, power, and urgency in the process. Tribes are considered dominant stakeholders; they have legitimacy and power, but their interests are, at this time, not viewed as urgent. Scientists are considered to have urgency and power. The developers viewed their stakeholder engagement strategy as open and transparent. Community stakeholders, regulators, and fishermen generally perceived the developer's approach as effective; they noted the company's accessibility and their efforts to engage stakeholders early and often. Given the dynamic nature of stakeholder salience, our findings highlight the importance of engaging dominant stakeholders so that future conflict can be more easily avoided as new information develops. Our approach can be used to inform stakeholder identification and engagement research in other renewable energy contexts.},

Wind turbines are expected to play a significant role in meeting these targets; however, despite high levels of support for the technology in principle, specific projects are often delayed or rejected on account of local opposition. This study aimed to establish how attitudes towards development might vary with respect to increasing distance from the identified sites. Participants were required to register their opinion towards development at a number of on- and off-shore locations in the UK. The results indicated that participants were most favourable to offshore development and least favourable to development at the identified sites. Attitudes to onshore development indicated that so long as a proposed location was anticipated to be `out of sight' it was considered in relatively general terms. The results are discussed with reference to site visibility and landscape concerns and clearly support calls for a shift towards community-focussed development strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous energy policies aiming at climate change mitigation have been implemented on a national and global scale. Renewable energy technologies (RETs) play a critical role in enhancing sustainable solutions that significantly limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Such innovative technologies can facilitate energy transition through providing, e.g., energy security, sustainable development, and effective usage of indigenous resources. However, the commercialization of RETs is extremely challenging. The barriers can be of a different nature, although this study focused on socioeconomic and regulatory issues. There is ample evidence that energy policies play a central role in supporting adoption of renewables. It is also claimed that RETs require the whole ecosystem to support their successful diffusion. In this study, we explored multifarious barriers for widespread RET diffusion in two European Union countries, Finland and Poland, indicating the most common barriers existing in the literature as well as analyzing major bottlenecks from the viewpoint of renewable energy companies' executives. We also present statistics of the most commonly used RETs in these countries in order to express the diffusion issues more appropriately. The research shows that inflexible, ineffective, and excessive regulatory frameworks; limited financing options; as well as an insufficient level of societal awareness have been seen as the main bottlenecks for RET diffusion in both countries. The outcomes of this study provide useful insights for the researchers in the energy transition field as well as practical managerial and regulatory implications aimed at overcoming these challenges.},

A broad literature exists on the merits of different community engagement techniques but important gaps remain in understandings of the particular challenges of engaging with island communities on energy issues. Based on a thematic literature review, this article examines general principles and considerations for community engagement on energy developments, features of islands that can affect community engagement, and how past engagement processes have sought to encourage community participation, gain trust, and manage conflicts over developments. The review indicates that island communities appeared to be particularly concerned with ensuring that engagement processes give adequate priority to securing local benefits and incorporate credible mechanisms for managing intra-community conflicts. The article concludes by arguing that islands provide important arenas for testing not just new energy technologies but also ways to improve the integration of justice principles into community engagement on energy issues.},

It provides new testable hypotheses on the how and why of the transition process using behavioural constructs such as perceptions and habits. In contrast, the current approach is to examine socio-demographic conditions and market/technology characteristics to identify- `who' are likely to move away from solid fuels and `under what conditions'. CI-CHANGE combines elements of the Transtheoretical Model (health behaviour change psychology), Theory of Planned Behaviour (social psychology), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (information systems research) to identify & prioritize intervention focus areas. Such framing highlights three key gaps in the current approach. First, based on process factor conditions of target audience, differential intervention strategies are necessary; second, post-sales interventions are required to support complex and effortful endeavor of accepting a new technology while fighting the old habit of traditional cooking; and third, entire transition process is fragile due to seasonal changes and no-cost reversal to solid fuels. Hence, long-term monitoring should back any intervention-specific climate/health gain projections.},

  abstract        = {The deployment of wind energy projects (WEP) within the process of energy transition changes energy landscapes and daily living environments. With regard to social acceptance as one social response towards WEP, the role of different aspects of justice (i.e. procedural, distributive, recognition) has been discussed. This study highlights the importance of social norms and their influence on perceived justice regarding WEP, which has been neglected in the literature so far. The relationship between social norms and perceived justice is explored as a conceptual framework through a systematic literature review and expert interviews. This framework aims to explain how social norms and their relationship with justice are defined, interlinked and how they affect perceptions of WEP. The results argue that social norms surface in situations where all the key elements of a project are decided without public impact. Thus, norms of fairness emerge under uncertain situations with the influence of similar emotions within groups. Moreover, social norms and perceived justice would explain several responses, such as local conflicts, or the motivation to further develop WEP. This study concludes by discussing the applicability of the framework, which needs further analysis as an analytical tool and deeper empirical investigation.},

  abstract      = {Today there are several opportunities for Renewable Energy Sources (RES), as well as for nuclear technologies to contribute to mitigating climate change and to promote sustainable development (SD). In this framework, the main scope of the present study is to provide an analysis and a direct point-to-point comparison of five promising renewable energy technologies, namely, biomass gasification, molten carbonate fuel cells fed with wood gas, Solar Photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal and offshore wind, in contrast to two advanced nuclear technologies, European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) and European Fast Reactor (EFR). The examination was made with regards to technology characteristics, sustainability factors and potential deployment drivers and barriers, obtained from relative studies. The analysis indicated that the examined RES and nuclear technologies both offer substantial contribution to climate change by effectively producing limited amounts of GHG emissions, which are close to zero for the nuclear technologies. The RES produce no significant waste and are generally favored by policy incentives, but some of them are plagued by high production costs and low efficiency. On the contrary, the examined nuclear technologies, despite their enhanced safety, reduced costs and minimized waste, still have to face the major issues of weapons proliferation, safety, waste handling and high costs as well as public acceptance, which have been affected by the recent Fukushima accident.

As governments play a crucial role in determining energy and environmental policy, developing practical policymaking tools encourages them to stimulate the adoption of renewable energy technology. This study proposes a novel framework to model an energy system transition focused on the power generation and its dynamic behavior of fossil-fuel-rich countries using the System Dy-namics (SD) approach and then assesses the techno-economic and environmental impacts of various economic, technical, and environmental policies using the Multi-Criteria Decision-Analysis technique (MCDA). This study aims to compare the development of renewable technologies development versus improving the current tech-nology efficiency under three different ``business as usual,'' ``basic development,'' and ``advanced development'' scenarios by assessing economic, environmental, and social indicators over the horizon of 2016-2040 in fossil-rich-fuel countries. The proposed framework was applied to Iran, a fossil-fuel-rich country. According to the case study results, in all of the defined policies under three scenarios, the improvement of fossil fuel technologies received the highest score indicating that improvement in the efficiency of the current energy system by utilizing combined cycle systems is an inevitable step. Taking into account the water shortage in Iran, the second crucial stage is the implementation of water-efficient renewable technologies.},

It analyses responses to representative surveys of the Norwegian population on the desirability of various energy technologies such as hydroelectric dams, onshore and offshore wind energy, bioenergy plants and, for contrast, gas plants with and without carbon capture and storage. Our main focus is on the influence of party political preference on views of renewable energy. We find that the sometimes lukewarm enthusiasm for renewable energy technologies cannot be fully explained by existing theories and that political party preference has a larger impact on energy technology attitudes than previously believed.

  abstract             = {The European Union (EU) imports a large amount of natural gas, and the injection of renewable hydrogen (H-2) into the natural gas systems could help decarbonize the sector. The new geopolitical and energy market situation demands urgent actions in the clean energy transition and energy independence from fossil fuels. This paper aims to investigate techno-economic analysis, barriers, and constraints in the EU policies/frameworks that affect natural gas decarbonization. First, the study examines the levelized cost of hydrogen production (LCOH). The LCOH is evaluated for blue and grey hydrogen, i.e., Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) natural gas as the feed-stock, with and without carbon capture, and green hydrogen (three type electrolyzers with electricity from the grid, solar, and wind) for the years 2020, 2030, and 2050. Second, the study evaluates the current policies and framework based on a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Weakness) analysis, which includes a PEST (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological) macro-economic factor assessment with a case study in Portugal. The results show that the cheapest production costs continue to be dominated by grey hydrogen (1.33 euro/kg.H-2) and blue hydrogen (1.68 euro/kg.H-2) in comparison to green hydrogen (4.65 euro/kg.H2 and 3.54 euro/kg.H-2) from grid electricity and solar power in the PEM -Polymer Electrolyte Membrane for the year 2020, respectively. The costs are expected to decrease to 4.03 euro/kg.H-2 (grid-electricity) and 2.49 euro/kg.H-2 (solar - electricity) in 2030. The LCOH of the green grid-electricity and solar/wind-powered Alkaline Electrolyzer (ALK) and Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) are also expected to decrease in the time-span from 2020 to 2050. A sensitivity analysis shows that investments costs, electricity price, the efficiency of electrolyzers, and carbon tax (for SMR) could play a key role in reducing LCOH, thereby making the economic competitiveness of hydrogen production. The key barriers are costs, amendments in rules/regulations, institutions and market creation, public perception, provisions of incentives, and constraints in creating market demand.},

The data comes from the recent deliberative polling process in South Korea on the construction of Shin-Kori nuclear reactor units 5 and 6. We specifically examined why certain people change from the ``oppose'' to ``support'' and vice versa by considering the nonlinearity effects of the demographic factors and knowledge acquired during the deliberation. By employing logistic regression analysis, we find that for the change of opinion from `resume/defer (not stop)' to `stop' construction of Shin-Kori units 5 and 6, the level of education, political ideology, household income, gender, and knowledge gain were found to be significant factors. On the other hand, the level of education, age, and political ideology were significant factors influencing the change of opinion from `stop/defer (not resume)' to `resume' construction. In addition, we find that the role of learning depends on political ideology: knowledge gain intensified the political divides on the issue. We also show that the significance of those demographic factors, especially political ideology, may come from the difference in risk perception and economic/stability assessment of the Shin-Kori nuclear power plants. The findings provide a deepened insight for policymakers around the world who may pursue public consensus building on national energy transition.},

This paper examines public sentiment toward solar energy in the United States using data from Twitter, a micro-blogging platform on which people post messages, known as tweets. We filtered tweets specific to solar energy and performed a classification task using Robustly optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa). Our RoBERTa-based sentiment classification model, fine-tuned with 6300 manually annotated tweets specific to solar energy, attains 80.2% accuracy for ternary (positive, neutral, or negative) classification. Analyzing 266,686 tweets during the period of January to December 2020, we find public sentiment varies widely across states (Coefficient of Variation =164.66%). Within the study period, the Northeast U.S. region shows more positive sentiment toward solar energy than did the South U.S. region. Public opinion on solar energy is more positive in states with a larger share of Democratic voters in the 2020 presidential election. Public sentiment toward solar energy is more positive in states with consumer-friendly net metering policies and a more mature solar market. States that wish to gain public support for solar energy might want to consider implementing consumer-friendly net metering policies and support the growth of solar businesses.},

However, their integration into the maritime sector presents complex regulatory challenges due to the convergence of nuclear and maritime laws. A unified, harmonized regulatory framework is essential to ensure safety, radioactive waste management, and accident prevention. While initiatives led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) are progressing, key gaps remain, particularly regarding maritime-specific risk assessments, emergency response protocols, and cross-border regulatory harmonization. Enhanced collaboration between regulatory bodies, pilot projects, and transparent engagement with stakeholders will be critical to refining safety protocols and accelerating regulatory alignment. Public acceptance remains a vital factor, requiring rigorous environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and transparent communication to build trust and align SMR-powered vessels with global sustainability objectives. While challenges persist, they also present opportunities for innovation and international cooperation. By addressing these regulatory and public acceptance challenges through coordinated efforts and policies, SMR propulsion can become a cornerstone of a more sustainable, efficient, and technologically advanced maritime sector. Successful deployment will position SMRs as a key component of the global energy transition, driving progress toward low-carbon shipping and a greener maritime industry.},

Efforts to explain this opposition have focused on perceived negative aesthetic and environmental impact. Less attention has been paid to a fuller suite of the perceived risks and benefits associated with new energy technologies. This paper thus investigates impacts of an offshore wind farm pertaining to individual perceptions and judgments, and why risks to some ecosystem services might be cause for greater public concern than others. We find that this difference can be attributed to the affective and intuitive ways in which people perceive risk. Our mixed-methods design used interviews (n = 27) that involved risk-benefit weighting tasks and an animated visualization to help people imagine an offshore wind farm in a familiar place. We found that affectively-loaded impacts (harm to charismatic wildlife and visual intrusion) were assigned greater weight than more easily quantifiable impacts (displacement of fishing, impact to tourism, cost of compliance with regulations). Interviewees identified increased regional energy self-sufficiency as the most valued potential benefit of an offshore wind farm. These results have implications for ecosystem service assessments generally and, more specifically, for our understanding of `affective' dimensions of development proposals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we focus on how residential energy storage technologies can enable householders to contribute to the energy transition. Drawing on literature that understands energy systems as sociotechnical configurations and the theory of `material participation', we examine how the introduction of home batteries affords new roles and energy practices for householders. We present qualitative findings from interviews with householders and other key stakeholders engaged in using or implementing battery storage at household and community level. Our results point to five emerging storage modes in which householders can play a role: individual energy autonomy; local energy community; smart grid integration; virtual energy community; and electricity market integration. We argue that for householders, these storage modes facilitate new energy practices such as providing grid services, trading, self-consumption, and sharing of energy. Several of the storage modes enable the formation of prosumer collectives and change relationships with other actors in the energy system. We conclude by discussing how householders also face new dependencies on information technologies and intermediary actors to organize the multi-directional energy flows which battery systems unleash. With energy storage projects currently being provider-driven, we argue that more space should be given to experimentation with (mixed modes of) energy storage that both empower householders and communities in the pursuit of their own sustainability aspirations and serve the needs of emerging renewable energy-based energy systems.},

While policy and research often focus on acceptance as an outcome, the process of acceptance remains a black box, especially in uncontested RET implementation contexts. We study the dynamic process of community acceptance where (1) different actor groups can have (2) different roles and (3) different active and passive responses towards (4) different objects of acceptance within the RET project implementation. Results show that community acceptance occurs over time and goes beyond citizen or resident acceptance alone. By unpacking different dimensions of acceptance, we show that even in uncontested cases, acceptance is ambiguous and includes various responses toward various objects. Furthermore, we see that roles can influence and interact dynamically with responses and that preferences for roles are heterogeneous. To move beyond acceptance as a merely coincidental outcome, but a widely embraced and intentional process, this process should meet the participatory needs of different actors.},

  abstract             = {Digitization of the energy industry is the key to a successful energy transition. To this end, all consumers and generators should be able to communicate permanently with each other so that the energy system as a whole functions safely and efficiently. Smart meter technology can make a contribution to this. Unfortunately, the rollout selected in Germany initially affects only about 11% of all consumers. The objective of this paper is therefore to determine the current status of this technology in companies and to pursue the research question of which factors influence acceptance and use. For this purpose, an extensive literature search with more than 50 keywords was conducted in scientific databases. After reviewing and cleaning the literature, 47 papers were selected for the literature review and considered in detail. The literature review was conducted using eight evaluation criteria: Origin and year of publication, identification of trends with Big Data and AI (artificial intelligence), type of organization, type of data, collection method, number of participants, type of data collection, and analysis method. In order to evaluate the main statements and results of the considered works, we also performed a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats Analysis (SWOT). Our analysis showed that: (1) The studies only address households as end-users, no companies are considered as end-users in relation to smart meter technology. (2) Technical aspects and barriers were often chosen as research focus and content, and secondary data were mostly used. (3) Studies examining soft factors such as acceptance criteria in general and for decision making are rare and also focused purely on residential customers. (4) Of the studies that collected primary data as part of their research, 71% used the survey method of a questionnaire survey. Further research should investigate company acceptance criteria, as this can increase implementation and make better predictions about the technology. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This is of particular importance as an increasing number of technologies and business models are focusing on the end-users. These developments provide new opportunities for further technical and social innovation to smarter, flexible and integrated systems such as community energy systems (CESs). Through system integration and community engagement CESs assist in transition to a low-carbon energy system. Despite the high importance, there is limited knowledge on willingness of local citizens to participate in the local energy systems such as CESs as well as associated factors determining such willingness. Through a survey among 599 citizens in the Netherlands, this research analyses the impact of demographic, socio-economic, socio-institutional as well as environmental factors on willingness to participate in CESs. Factor and multi-variate regression analysis reveals that the environmental concern, renewables acceptance, energy independence, community trust, community resistance, education, energy related education and awareness about local energy initiatives are the most important factors in determining the citizens' willingness to participate in CESs. Citizens should be empowered to take active role in steering the local energy initiatives.},

This support should go beyond social acceptance, which is a rather passive attitude, and should include social factors such as willingness to participate in energy transition and willingness to use renewable energy sources. However, moving from awareness to action is a complex process and requires understanding of social factors. Until recently scientific research was mainly focused on technical and economic factors of energy transition however the volume of scientific results published by social science energy research is growing. The focus of this paper is on how people are making choices and which factors are influencing their choices. Research based on social sciences and behavioral economics shows preferences and rationalities of people when it comes to the question of available in frames of energy transition alternatives. The results of this paper are based on large-scale surveys, decision-making experiments and interviews conducted in Germany, Austria, Finland, Morocco, Jordan and Iran. The results show high level of awareness about the need of climate change mitigation across countries, which is decreasing with the level of details about the projects or the energy transition processes. The results also show dominance of economic rationality with concerns about energy prices and socioeconomic impacts from energy transition over other concerns such as environmental protection. Also, such factors as maintenance and reparation of technology and possibility to participate in decision-making processes have impact on willingness to support energy transition which goes beyond social acceptance.},

Turkiye, endowed with rich energy fields, stands out as one of the fastest-growing countries in geothermal energy. The dramatic installed power capacity increase and significant expansion in the geothermal energy market, particularly after 2010 following the initiation of the incentive scheme, are pretty remarkable. Nonetheless, it is also evident that geothermal energy investments in the country have shown a decreasing trend in recent years. At this point, this paper aims to reveal the opportunities and challenges in the development of geothermal energy as the first comprehensive qualitative analysis for Turkiye. Furthermore, it evaluates the diffusion of geothermal energy in Turkiye based on the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework to gain insight into the Turkish geothermal sector. According to the interviewees, financial and political barriers such as high investor costs, insufficient incentives for power generation, and the lack of incentives for direct utilization, along with lengthy and exhausting permitting processes, still hinder the prevalence of geothermal energy utilization in the country. Respondents find that Geothermal suggests a huge opportunity for the Green Energy transition in Turkiye and aids economic development through increases in employment opportunities and household welfare using combined uses in district heating, electricity, and greenhouse usage.},

The future of the transition depends on more than just technological development or economic feasibility. Rather, a positive attitude and an understanding by the general public are critical to its success. Therefore, communicating the complex, polarized and long-term process in an objective way is essential. We show that despite the alleged clarity of goals, German stakeholders have very diverse reasons for their support of the energy transition. One key reason mentioned is climate protection. Another important goal is the desired independence from energy imports. This diversity is at the heart of the communication challenges. We see a wide variety of goals triggering trade-offs and challenges in understanding the process. Therefore, we suggest an infographic as an approach to communicating the energy transition to the general public with a focus on goals and related future challenges of the transition. We conclude that communication tools should promote an inclusive discussion and debate regarding the goals and challenges of a process, such as the energy transition, to help answer the question: How do we want to live in the future?},

These regions, deeply rooted in lignite mining, face profound socio-economic transformations driven by the EU Green Deal and its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The transition from coal dependency to renewable energy represents not only a critical environmental goal but also a significant socio-economic challenge for local communities, necessitating innovative and inclusive strategies to mitigate impacts and ensure equitable outcomes. The research integrates desk studies with stakeholder surveys (n = 129) to assess public awareness, perceived impacts, and acceptance of HPHS technology as a repurposing solution for decommissioned open-pit lignite mines. Results reveal that while awareness of the energy transition process is high (90% in Western Macedonia and 80% in & Lstrok;& oacute;dzkie Region), familiarity with HPHS technology varies significantly (76% and 48%, respectively). Support for implementing HPHS in former mining sites is stronger in Western Macedonia (73%) compared to & Lstrok;& oacute;dzkie Region (63%), with knowledge of HPHS correlating positively with acceptance (r = 0.83, p ¡ 0.01). Both regions recognize the environmental benefits of HPHS, including improved air quality and biodiversity; yet, socio-economic challenges such as job losses, reduced income levels, and limited opportunities for reskilling persist, particularly in & Lstrok;& oacute;dzkie Region, where 77% of respondents view the energy transition as negatively impacting the labor market. By focusing on regions historically dependent on mining, this study highlights the critical role of addressing the unique needs of communities undergoing systemic transformation. The repurposing of former lignite mines into HPHS facilities offers a promising pathway for balancing environmental objectives with local socio-economic revitalization. However, success requires region-specific strategies, including transparent communication, stakeholder involvement, and targeted investment in workforce adaptation and infrastructure. These findings contribute to the growing discourse on how socially inclusive and technically feasible solutions can drive equitable energy transitions in post-mining regions.},

Nonetheless, public opposition has been increasing and the discussion regarding siting wind turbines onshore or offshore is consistently present in public discourse. In combining a stated preference study with spatial data processed via GIS (Geographic Information Systems), spatial preferences for onshore and offshore wind turbines are explored while considering their visual impact and costs as well as controlling for the respondents' socioeconomic characteristics. In general, respondents state strong preferences towards offshore wind turbines as opposed to onshore. Furthermore, spatial data is found to be significant with regard to the preferences of the respondents, particularly respondents' distance to the coast and potential offshore wind farms and the number of wind turbines seen from the residence and the number of turbines in the postal area. As a secondary result, findings suggest socioeconomic characteristics such as age and income are significantly related to respondents' preferences, in line with previous research.},

Little is known about the acceptance of multiple low-carbon energy technologies. This study bridges this research gap and explores the cross-technology acceptance of various energy solutions at different locations. Thus, we provide a comprehensive understanding of public acceptance patterns by analysing a broader range of technologies concurrently, focusing on: (a) nuclear power, (b) district heating, (c) energy-saving technologies, (d) onshore, nearshore, and offshore wind power (WP), (e) photovoltaics (PV) installed on agricultural land, industrial roofs, and private roofs, and (f) carbon capture and storage (CCS) in offshore, nearshore, rural onshore, and urban onshore locations. Based on Danish nationally representative survey data, our results give strong policy indications that PV on industrial rooftops is accepted at the highest level. In contrast, nuclear power, onshore rural and urban CCS, and nearshore CCS are the least accepted technologies to combat climate change among the Danish public. Additionally, we discover that the acceptance of a specific technology is contingent on locations. Specifically, the public acceptance of PV, WP, and CCS depends on the place of living and the potential location of technology placement. Finally, this study explores subgroup analyses to compare acceptance differences according to gender, age, education, income, and location of residence.},

  abstract  = {Malaysia aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, addressing climate change by transitioning to low-carbon electricity. With the power sector contributing 36 % of carbon emissions in 2019, solar photovoltaic (PV) is a key solution, given Malaysia's abundant sunshine. While government roadmaps emphasize solar PV, the retrofit market remains underexplored. This study investigates barriers to rooftop solar PV adoption in existing houses using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), examining economic, environmental, social, technological, and regulatory factors. Combining quantitative surveys and in-depth interviews, it identifies drivers and obstacles, providing actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to accelerate adoption and support Malaysia's decarbonization goals. Findings from SEM indicate that Performance Expectancy (PE, beta = 0.311, p ¡ 0.001), Price Value (PV, beta = 0.245, p = 0.006), Facilitating Conditions (FC, beta = 0.311, p ¡ 0.001) and Environmental Concern (EC, beta = 0.253, p ¡ 0.001) significantly predict Behavioral Intention (BI) to adopt rooftop solar PV systems. Social Influence (SI, beta = -0.111, p = 0.165), Effort Expectancy (EE, beta = -0.098, p = 0.266) and Hedonic Motivation (HM, beta = 0.082, p = 0.167) were statistically insignificant. The model explained 88.6 % of the variance (R-2 = 0.886), with high sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.949). However, qualitative findings reveal that Social Influence plays a significant role in shaping BI, highlighting the importance of peer recommendations and community perceptions. These integrated findings highlight the importance of considering economic, social, and environmental factors in the adoption process. This study expands the applicability of UTAUT2 to new technology research, particularly for rooftop solar PV, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to promote solar PV adoption and support Malaysia's decarbonization goals.},

This present study examines the sentiment of public opinion towards various energy technologies on Twitter during the Dutch 2021 general elections. A dataset comprising 186,822 tweets and profile descriptions was analyzed using two automated text classifiers to explore how individuals with different self-proclaimed identities perceive green-energy technologies. The analysis involved the application of the sentiment and social identity classifier models, followed by a frequency and co-occurrence analysis. The findings revealed a negative overall sentiment towards green-energy technologies in the Twitter discourse. It further showed that perceptions may differ depending on a technology's development stage, with emerging technologies generally receiving more favorable views compared to established ones. Furthermore, it was found that, although there is a general trend of negative sentiment based on political identity, and positive sentiment based on occupational identity, this trend did not consistently apply to specific energy technologies. This discrepancy can likely be attributed to varying implementation effects and contextual situations associated with the technologies. The findings suggest that personalized communication strategies for specific social groups may be beneficial for understanding and addressing public opinions, needs, and concerns within the energy transition. The complexity of understanding public opinion in the context of green-energy highlights the need for a nuanced approach in future research.},

This article identifies factors influencing the acceptance of wind energy and selects those factors which have the highest relevance for wind energy acceptance in Bavaria. We decided to analyze the Federal State of Bavaria in Germany as its current policy governance decelerates the building-up of wind turbines in this federal state. Using a qualitative approach, the results indicate that the perception of political processes, such as the recent enacting of the 10-H regulation in Bavaria, influences the acceptance towards wind energy, as trust and transparency in political processes are essential. In addition, the paper reveals the importance of the distributive justice, focusing in particular on the subitem envy, which can be considered on a neighboring or regional level. Additionally it reveals additional factors which are relevant for wind energy acceptance in the specific case of the analyzed federal state. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our analysis shows that this transition will require decarbonizing the power, transport, and industry sectors, and the transition pathway will be country-specific. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will play a major role in this energy transition by decarbonizing existing and new fossil fuel power plants and the production of low-carbon fossil-fuel-based blue hydrogen. Blue hydrogen can be used for hydrogen fuel cell mobility in the transport sector and heat and feedstock in the industry sector. Current estimates show that there is adequate CO2 storage capacity in the world's saline aquifers and oil and gas reservoirs to store 2 centuries of anthropogenic CO2 emission. However, the slow pace of CCS implementation is concerning and is due, in part, to too low of an oil price to make CO2-enhanced oil recovery profitable, lack of financial incentives for CO2 geological storage, low public acceptance, lack of consistent government energy policy and CCS regulations, and high capital investment. We propose several ways to accelerate CCS implementation. Among others, they include establishing regional CCS corridors to make use of economy of scale, public CCS engagement, carbon pricing, and using public-private partnership for financing, technology transfer, and linking up different stakeholders.},

Offshore resources benefit from higher energy density, smaller visual impacts, and higher availability levels. Offshore locations at the West of Crete obtain wind availability approximate to 80%, combining this with the installation potential for large scale modern wind turbines (rated power) then expected annual benefits are immense. Temporal variability of production is a limiting factor for wider adaptation of large offshore farms. To this end multi-generation with wave energy can alleviate issues of non-generation for wind. Spatio-temporal correlation of wind and wave energy production exhibit that wind and wave hybrid stations can contribute significant amounts of clean energy, while at the same time reducing spatial constrains and public acceptance issues. Offshore technologies can be combined as co-located or not, altering contribution profiles of wave energy to non-operating wind turbine production. In this study a co-located option contributes up to 626 h per annum, while a non co-located solution is found to complement over 4000 h of a non-operative wind turbine. Findings indicate the opportunities associated not only in terms of capital expenditure reduction, but also in the ever important issue of renewable variability and grid stability.},

An increase in the electricity tariff is required to help the expansion of renewable energy and accelerate the energy transition. It is therefore necessary to understand public acceptance of the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policies implemented by the Korean government to expand renewable energy. This study analyzes public's heterogeneous preferences of renewable energy policies and identifies the determinants of people's divided reactions to the policy. This study also forecasts the change in the degree of public acceptance of renewable energy expansion until 2030 and provides suggestions for the enhancement of public awareness and acceptance of the RPS plan. The simulation analysis shows that a sharp decline in the public's acceptance rate is to be expected when the renewable energy expansion target becomes more challenging in 2025. The drastic change in acceptance is attributed to the electricity tariff spike. We conclude that the government should prepare to address the severe backlash from the public against the increase in electricity tariff to have a successful renewable energy policy.},

The first contribution is methodological, recognizing more effective and inclusive forms of engagement begin with building reciprocal relationships and collaborative research partnerships operationalizing the tenets of energy justice. Employing these methodological recom-mendations, we conducted a collaborative, inclusive, and equitable research design and engagement practice by collaborating with Tribal members on research with expressly mutual benefits. In this work, a years-long collaboration of Tribal members and non-Tribal researchers developed a methodology to survey respondents at an accessible and culturally relevant community event to learn about preferences and perceived barriers to transitioning to RE. A second contribution is empirical. The results suggest shared priorities for energy solutions that enhance energy sovereignty, i.e., community control and ownership of energy services provisioning. They also demonstrate widespread awareness regarding barriers to a RE transition and simultaneously, some potential misperceptions about the challenges to transition. This study reinforces the need for SA research to move beyond asking what technologies receive public support and where those technologies should be sited to consider how access and transparency in planning processes, collaboration, engagement, development, ownership, and ben-efits are organized and can be radically reconfigured to enable the just transition to a decarbonized energy system.},

  abstract             = {We empirically derive the determinants of British public preferences for different low-carbon energy sources using machine learning algorithm-based variable selection methods (ridge, lasso, and elastic net regression models). We seek to understand the drivers of support for solar, wind, biomass, and nuclear energy, which are the largest low-carbon energy sources and together account for the majority of UK power generation. Explanatory variables examined include those related to demographics, knowledge, perceptions of climate change, and government policy. We carry out a comparative study by synthesising the results of our independent analyses for each energy source and find that the preferred energy sources vary with respondents' views on anticipated climate change impacts. Those who believe that potential effects of climate change will be catastrophic tend to prefer renewable energy sources whereas those less concerned about climate change tend to prefer nuclear power. The public also prefers energy sources about which they are more familiar or knowledgeable. Energy transition policies should be adjusted to better consider the factors that drive public acceptance of low-carbon energy sources, including exploring ways to secure policy support that considers energy source-specific characteristics and expanding public awareness of climate change and individual technologies, particularly among certain demographics.},

  abstract             = {Background Every energy transition has had its winners and its losers, both economically and in terms of social justice and community cohesion. The current transition is no different given the complex, intersecting matrices of power and experience that influence the key stakeholders and actors involved. Local oppositions to the deployment of renewable energy technologies have been significantly higher than expected. In numerous instances, these oppositions have been in reaction to the disempowerment of local rights and entitlements associated with specific developments. Consequently, there is a clear need for governance structures and organisational formats that are participatory, inclusive and mindful of the lived experiences of local people. Despite the knowledge gaps and financial constraints that continue to persist, how can local communities become empowered to drive project development and meaningfully engage in the low-carbon energy transition? Methods This paper presents a methodology for investigating citizen perceptions of the energy transition and the kinds of roles they see themselves having in its implementation. Working with six communities across five European countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK), we conducted a series of iterative cross-sectional community engagements using a mixed methods approach. In addition, a number of innovative participatory action research tools were incorporated to engage citizens in co-designing their own energy transition pathways. Results Participants expressed having restricted agency as citizens participating in the energy system. They also felt locked in to a limiting set of false choices as `energy consumers' that do not translate into real or meaningful power, despite popular narratives to the contrary. The research also resulted in a co-designed characterisation tool to help local communities assess the energy democracy and citizen participation potential of a number of participatory business models. Conclusions Citizens remain locked out of the decision-making processes of the energy transition. We outline a more integrated approach, using co-design and participatory action research, to incorporate citizen perspectives into the planning and implementation of more appropriate business configurations. This paper presents demonstrable examples of how extended stakeholder perspectives can improve procedural justice outcomes and ensure the rollout of more equitable energy configurations into the future.},

  abstract             = {Despite the global context, only 6% of Australia's total energy consumption was derived from renewables, while 86.3% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels. However, this trend has been disrupted by the recent decommissioning and closure of a fleet of ageing coal power plants, along with the country's international commitments to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Currently, Australia is at a crucial stage of its transition to renewable energy adoption. With the purpose of providing an updated depiction of renewable energy, related policy and the way ahead in the Australian context, this research paper presents a systematic review of contemporary literature from the perspectives of energy potential, utilisation and policy incentives. The research analysed a total of 118 documents using an interpretivist epistemological lens; emergent findings offer an evidence-based, lucid account of advancements in the renewable energy market. Polynomial regression analysis is also conducted on secondary data obtained from the literature to predict trends in the electricity generated by different sources of renewable energy. The work also identifies several areas that require attention, including: (1) the most recent time-varying feed-in tariffs (TV FiTs) which offer the innate potential to alter consumer attitudes toward power usage at peak times, thereby improving grid security; (2) the increasingly popular integration of waste-to-energy with other sources of renewable energy emerges as a viable complementary solution to meet energy demands; (3) the increasing utilisation of subsidised geothermal energy installations which are set to rise exponentially in the future; and (4) the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for developing renewable energy generation infrastructure and how this investment may facilitate the national transition to renewable energy adoption. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by raising awareness of the current state of renewable energy in Australia, along with proposing pragmatic recommendations for overcoming any challenges posed. As a comprehensive reference, this study provides practitioners and policymakers with thorough, reliable and collated information on Australia's current renewable energy position.

For example, Europe has set ambitious targets to achieve 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. However, numerous case studies from different countries have found that accelerating the transition to net-zero carbon emissions is easily hampered by the lack of a coherent systems framework, and that implementation gaps remain at the community level. These barriers are often due to a lack of an adequate end-user (i.e., household) input and early planning participation. This work therefore aims to improve on conventional planning methods that do not reflect innovative technologies with uncertainty and may not be applicable due to the lack of community empowerment, which is a dynamic learning and intervention opportunity for end-users at different planning stages (i.e., outreach, survey, planning, implementation, management, and maintenance). Using the lessons learned from participatory action research, whereby the author was involved as a project director throughout the planning and design process, we identified a six-step cycle principle. The steps are (1) collective action commitments, (2) local values and resource identification, (3) carbon footprint inventory, (4) optimized integration of environment, economy, and energy action plans, (5) Flexible strategic energy system plans, and (6) digital performance monitoring. Ultimately, the outcomes provide application support for policymakers and planners and stimulate community engagement to contribute to the achievement of zero net carbon emissions.},

While HVPLs often face public opposition, the energy transition and renewables are generally perceived positively. Drawing on the importance of benefit perception and affective responses for the acceptance of technologies, the present study investigated whether the perception of HVPLs changes when they are seen as a necessary measure for the successful energy transition. The results show that HVPLs are associated with more positive feelings, higher perceived benefit, lower perceived risk, and higher general and local acceptance when they are linked to the energy transition. However, numerous people believed that the energy transition renders further grid expansions unnecessary. This belief proved to be resistant to the provision of contrary information. Furthermore, the results underline the effect of visual impacts on the acceptance of HVPLs. Changes to the electricity grid that are accompanied by less visual impacts (e.g., technological modification) are more accepted than more visually disruptive changes (e.g., new construction). Finally, the findings emphasize the importance of affective response for the acceptance of HVPLs, especially for local acceptance. The results have several important implications for energy policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The public prefers high-voltage power lines (HVPLs) to be buried underground. Despite the perceived advantages of undergrounding, underground HVPLs can leave visible traces on the surface and are accompanied by electromagnetic field emissions. Given the importance of visual and health impacts on public acceptance of HVPLs, the present study investigates whether providing people with relevant information on these aspects of undergrounding influences people's perception. The results show that, after receiving this information, participants viewed underground HVPLs with lower acceptance, lower perceived benefits, higher perceived risks, and less positive feelings. Although public acceptance remained higher for underground HVPLs compared with overhead HVPLs, our study reveals that information provision reduces perceived differences between the two technologies. Furthermore, our results show that affective reactions to underground HVPLs have an indirect effect on public acceptance. We conclude that providing people with relevant information on possible drawbacks related to undergrounding is a necessary precondition for informed decision-making in the context of grid expansions.},

This article reports the findings of a mail survey sent to residents of the Hawaiian island of O'ahu investigating attitudes toward SWAC and opinions of installing a system in Waikiki. Results show that while only 55% of O'ahu residents were previously aware of SWAC, 62% supported its development in Waikiki and just 7% opposed. Of those familiar with the technology, support rose to 69%. However, when compared to eight other low-carbon energy options, SWAC ranked second to last. Concern exists about the potential environmental impacts of SWAC, particularly with regard to reef damage and algae production. Logistic regression analysis shows no significant difference in the likelihood of a person supporting SWAC due to their sex or level of education; although age, political affiliation, and locality do affect the likelihood of support. Those who see tourism as very important to Hawai'i and think SWAC will benefit the tourism industry are more likely to support, along with those who have a very positive opinion of renewable energy, and those who are familiar with the technology. In contrast, high-income O'ahu residents are less likely to support SWAC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Other sites investigated continue to plague regulators with unresolved questions. The concerns at three sites, Massachusetts Bay, Empire Knight, and Gulf of Farallones are primarily being driven by concern over public perception regarding risk to human health and/or the marine ecosystem. A large suite of acoustic devices, electro-optic imaging systems, remotely operated vehicles and submersibles now enable the application of a range continuum of resolution for offshore site investigations. A systematic investigative approach along a continuum beginning with broad scale, low-resolution data followed as warranted by increasingly higher resolving technologies appears to be the most expedient and flexible systematic approach for chronic sites. However, the high cost of advanced technologies and logistics for offshore investigations, aggravated by reduced agency budgets for research and response is limiting technological access, data acquisition and site investigation closure. New ways of leveraging limited dollars are necessary to fulfill mandates, missions, and research and development needs.},

The complexity, scale, and location of these developments make international ownership and export of electricity more feasible. We examine how the general public's acceptance of wind energy will be affected by a political shift in focus from onshore to nearshore or offshore locations, from local or national dominance of ownership to international dominance, and from meeting local or national needs to meeting international ones. We use a nationwide choice experiment with 1612 individuals in Norway to reveal the preferences for these attributes and apply a mixed logit regression model to estimate the willingness to pay to avoid certain outcomes. We show that, although respondents prefer offshore and nearshore locations to onshore ones, they are even more concerned with maintaining local or national control both through ownership and intended use of the added electricity. Although the preferences for national ownership are strong for both nearshore and offshore alternatives, the preference for meeting national needs becomes less important when wind energy developments are located farther off the coast. Three wind energy scenarios are used to further investigate these preferences: 1) international consortium for offshore wind energy, 2) national alliances for nearshore wind energy, and 3) local energy communities for onshore wind energy. We also discuss how a shift to nearshore and offshore wind energy can be enabled by paying greater attention to people's concerns over national control of wind energy resources.},

General acceptance of wind power plants and electricity pylons was affected by trust, with trust in technology playing a more important role than trust in stakeholders.

However, research on public acceptance of biogas plants has been a small part of the research on renewable energy sources. The aims of the article were to (I) examine the public awareness of agricultural biogas plants, (II) analyze the public opinion on the perception of biogas plants in a diverse landscape, and (III) perform visual assessment of the landscape with an existing biogas plant based on investments from Poland. A combination of methodological approaches was used to achieve the aims: survey research and visual assessment. Survey research was used to investigate the public awareness and perception of biogas plants in a diverse landscape. Visual assessment of operating biogas plant in the rural landscape was performed using the JAR-WAK landscape evaluation method. The conducted research showed that, according to the respondents, the biggest disadvantage of biogas plants is odors, and the greatest benefit is the production of energy and heat. The surveyed people also negatively perceived landscapes with biogas plants. However, the visual assessment for operating a biogas plant indicated no negative impact on the landscape.},

  abstract             = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are widely regarded as an important component of the technology portfolio designed to accomplish policy goals in sustainability and energy security. However, the market acceptance of PEVs in the future remains largely uncertain from today's perspective. By integrating a consumer choice model based on nested multinomial logit and Monte Carlo simulation, this study analyzes the uncertainty of PEV market penetration using Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the future market for PEVs is highly uncertain and there is a substantial risk of low penetration in the early and midterm market. Top factors contributing to market share variability are price sensitivities, energy cost, range limitation, and charging availability. The results also illustrate the potential effect of public policies in promoting PEVs through investment in battery technology and infrastructure deployment. Continued improvement of battery technologies and deployment of charging infrastructure alone do not necessarily reduce the spread of market share distributions, but may shift distributions toward right, i.e., increase the probability of having great market success.},

  abstract             = {The rising demand for energy and the aim of moving away from fossil fuels and to low-carbon power have led many countries to move to alternative sources including solar energy, wind, geothermal energy, biomass, and hydrogen. Hydrogen is often considered a ``missing link'' in guaranteeing the energy transition, providing storage, and covering the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy generation. However, due to potential injustice with regard to the distribution of risks, benefits, and costs (i.e., in regard to competing for land use), the large-scale deployment of hydrogen is a contested policy issue. This paper draws from a historical analysis of past energy projects to contribute to a more informed policy-making process toward a more just transition to the hydrogen economy. We perform a systematic literature review to identify relevant conflict factors that can influence the outcome of hydrogen energy transition projects in selected Economic Community of West African States countries, namely Nigeria and Mali. To better address potential challenges, policymakers must not only facilitate technology development, access, and market structures for hydrogen energy policies but also focus on energy access to affected communities. Further research should monitor hydrogen implementation with a special focus on societal impacts in producing countries.},

Design/methodology/approach A data driven approach has been conducted. The collection of the peoples' opinions has been realized on two specific social network communities as follows: Twitter and Instagram. The text mining processes carried out a sentiment and a cluster analysis. Findings The sentiment analysis of the most frequent words has been shown. The following four main homogeneous categories of words are emerged in relation to the decommissioning of offshore platforms: technological areas, green governance (GG), circular economy and socio-economic sphere. Research limitations/implications The alternative use of the offshore platforms, including tourism initiatives, aquaculture, alternative energy generation, hydrogen storage and environmental research, could improve the resilience of communities by offering the development of new jobs and the growth of local and innovative green businesses. Practical implications The adoption of a circular model and GG initiatives aims to limit the input of resources and energy, minimize waste and losses, adopt a sustainable approach and realize new social and territorial value. Originality/value The analysis underlines the importance to adopt a systems perspective, which takes into account the social, economic and environmental system as a whole, the different phenomena that occur and the variety of categories of stakeholders, from users to local governments that participate in the territorial development.},

Furthermore, citizens also join energy communities, vote, protest, openly discuss, express their rights and responsibilities, and campaign based on their preferences around energy, which formulate communicative energy citizenship. Although many studies examine and describe energy citizenship, few examine the factors that contribute to citizenship behaviors. Understanding how various forms of capital relate to different manifestations of energy citizenship can shed light on factors that obstruct the transition to renewable energy. Therefore, to mitigate these obstacles, we ask how energy citizenship can be stimulated by the forms of capital, which are introduced by Pierre Bourdieu to promote the use and acceptance of renewable energy. To answer this question, we perform content analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with residents from wind turbine-adjacent neighborhoods in the Netherlands. We examine how people's economic, cultural, and social capital may encourage them to move from more passive participation in energy systems to more active forms. The findings reveal complex interactions that are at play between and within the types of capitals and energy citizenship.},

  abstract             = {Many countries or regions, in recent years, show a rising interest in prefabrication as a ``cleaner'' production strategy to meet their enormous construction demand, e.g. for housing and infrastructure. Along with this trend is the observation that many governments tend to set forth a high level of prefabrication as a part of their ambitious construction plan. This paper argues that unnecessarily a higher level of prefabrication is better and develops an analytical framework for questing the optimal level of prefabrication adoption in a certain PEST (political, economic, social and technological) background. This framework contains thirteen PEST factors affecting the prefabrication adoption, including policy, supply, labor, social attitude, user acceptance, and so on. These factors in combination will determine the optimal prefabrication adoption level from 0 to 4, which was defined by Gibb 2001 to represent the range from entire cast-in-situ construction to complete prefabricated building, respectively. The framework was substantiated by using Hong Kong's prominent offshore prefabrication construction as a case. It was identified that Levels 2 and 3 are the optimal level of prefabrication adoption subject to the current PEST background in Hong Kong. This paper helps to clarify the prevailing misconception that ``the higher the prefabrication level, the better''. The developed framework can be used by other economies to devise their proper prefabrication roadmaps. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract             = {Background: Media coverage can play an important part in energy transitions. It creates awareness of landscape-level megatrends affecting energy systems. It influences and is influenced by public and policy agendas on a regime level. On a niche level, it can spread or screen out information and motivate or discourage actors to adopt new technologies and practices. However, relatively few studies have specifically addressed the role of media in energy transitions. Newspaper coverage of biogas is studied here as a case of media framing of a potential renewable energy solution. Methods: This article examines the long-term development of newspaper coverage of biogas in Finland. The aim of the quantitative content analysis is to draw an overall picture of the main phases of biogas coverage of a widely read newspaper focusing on agriculture and forestry, actors using discursive power in this coverage and key framings of the discussion. The results are discussed from the perspective of energy transition studies. In particular, future expectations created by the media are explored. Results: The results show a lack of newspaper coverage on biogas in the early 2000s, followed by a rapid increase and stabilisation of the volume of newspaper coverage. Biogas was most often mentioned as a secondary topic of broader discussions related to renewable energy. The core discussion focusing on biogas was characterised by very positive framings of biogas as a preferable energy solution fully compatible with the principle of circular economy. The news stories often had a strong future orientation, and examples of enthusiastic forerunners were frequently presented. However, the coverage also emphasised the poor economic profitability of biogas technologies and a need for considerable public subsidies that are inherently unpredictable. Conclusions: The future of niche-level energy technologies such as biogas can be strongly shaped by information flows, public perceptions and expectations created in part by media coverage. The analysed newspaper coverage in Finland was ambivalent from the perspective of energy transition. On the one hand, biogas production was represented as a preferable, environmentally friendly niche-level energy technology that should be encouraged. On the other hand, by emphasising the economic unviability of biogas technologies, the analysed newspaper coverage did not promote the adoption of biogas.},

This paper challenges the argument often put forward that, due to the greater distances from centres of population, it will be `easier' to garner public and stakeholder support for offshore CO2 storage than onshore. Based on the results of research interviews carried out with stakeholders and informed publics in Scotland, challenges for public and stakeholder acceptance of sub-seabed CO2 storage that may require further policy attention are identified. Whilst existing policy for sub-seabed CO2 storage is cognisant of the need for societal engagement, it may be the case that these regulations may need further reinforcement to ensure future developments are able to address social acceptability issues as fully as possible. The value of taking into account social as well as physical characteristics at the site selection phase, the need for mechanisms to take seriously stakeholder conceptions of uncertainty, and the importance of extending social engagement beyond risk communication are discussed.

  abstract             = {Smart grids (SGs) are being deployed as a transformational technology in energy transitions. However, negative consumer responses to both smart meters and new pricing systems indicate that building public acceptance of these transitions is critically important. Deliberative Pollings (DPs) offer the potential to effectively integrate public perceptions into energy transition decision-making. Most deliberative governance studies focus on western countries and very few examine the Asian context. This paper presents an exploratory study of undergraduate students' perceptions of dynamic pricing options in two pilot DPs conducted in the cities of Guangzhou and Kyoto. The study indicates that deliberative processes yield mixed outcomes in changing participants' choice of pricing options. While many welcomed new pricing options, a significant number supported status quo options. Second, the normative mechanisms and outcomes of deliberative participation seem to apply in the Asian context. DP appears to enhance participants' acceptance of complex and sophisticated pricing options. Dialogic processes enhanced the participants' ability to understand complex issues and weigh up trade-offs when comparing options. Third, national level contextual differences associated with public distrust and familiarity with market logic may explain the differences in responses between Chinese and Japanese participants. We argue that complex and controversial energy decision-making needs to be supported by deliberative participatory processes to enable citizens to make informed and considered choices.

Whereas public acceptance is recognized to be of great importance - and even equal to the technology - in the success of energy projects [9], HET' acceptance is questionable. This study aims (a) to portray the works that have focused on the acceptance of HET, (b) to highlight the limits of acceptance-based approaches, (c) to point out the benefits of adopting a Needs' anticipation approach rather than an acceptance-based approach in human technology relationship issues, (d) to attest its relevance in the context of HET and (e) to propose a Needs' anticipation approach related to a need seeker innovation strategy. Our findings indicate that a large majority of the studies followed a techno-centered approach of acceptance. We propose a paradigm shift regarding human technology relationship approach by making the dichotomy between traditional acceptance-based approach and Needs anticipation approach. While the first is techno-centered and aim to push for the use of a technology by modulating deployment conditions, the second is human-centered and has the ambition to shape the technology to the user's future needs and requirements. Thereby, given the high stakes and the future-oriented nature related to HET issues, we support the idea that a Needs' anticipation approach must be applied in designing HET to ensure future uses.},

  abstract      = {The energy transition is a major societal issue to which hydrogen energy can make an important contribution. If the technical aspects of hydrogen energy seem paramount, it is also important to focus on the end users of these future systems. Indeed, users play an important role in the success of energy systems: they may not accept it, they may not use it as intended. But not only, users can also be a source of innovation. Thus, it is possible to mobilize different approaches, which if they are all legitimate, do not have the same efficiency. In this systematic review of the literature, which combines lexical analysis and data analysis of 152 publications, we identify the approaches implemented to take into account users in Hydrogen Energy Systems. Our results indicate that final users are mostly perceived as a barrier to the deployment of Hydrogen Energy Systems, or as a parameter to be assessed rather than as a resource for the design. Researches have mainly the aim of improving technology adoption. Since Hydrogen Energy Systems are emerging, we recommend focusing studies on upstream user research aimed at stimulating and enhancing technologies and systems design. We also recommend increasing the share of study which focus on the case of hydrogen energy stationary applications and buildings. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract             = {The North Sea region, located in the Northwest of Europe, is expected to be a frontrunner in the European energy transition. This paper aims to analyse different optimal system configurations in order to meet net-zero emission targets in 2050. Overall, the paper presents two main contributions: first, we develop and introduce the IESA-NS model. The IESA-NS model is an optimization integrated energy system model written as a linear problem. The IESA-NS model optimizes the long-term investment planning and short-term operation of seven North Sea region countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The model can optimize multiple years simultaneously, accounts for all the national GHG emissions and includes a thorough representation of all the sectors of the energy system. Second, we run several decarbonisation scenarios with net-zero emission targets in 2050. Relevant parameters varied to produce the scenarios include biomass availability, VRE potentials, low social acceptance of onshore VRE, ban of CCUS or mitigation targets in international transport and industry feedstock. Results show a large use of hydrogen when international transport emissions are considered in the targets (5.6 EJ to 7.3 EJ). Electrolysis is the preferred pathway for hydrogen production (up to 6.4 EJ), far ahead of natural gas reforming (up to 2.2 EJ). Allowing offshore interconnectors (e.g. meshed offshore grid between the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom) permits to integrate larger amounts of offshore wind (122 GW to 191 GW of additional capacity compared to reference scenarios), while substantially increasing the cross-border interconnection capacities (up to 120 GW). All the biomass available is used in the scenarios across multiple end uses, including biofuel production (up to 3.5 EJ), high temperature heat (up to 2.5 EJ), feedstock for industry (up to 2 EJ), residential heat (up to 600 PJ) and power generation (up to 900 PJ). In general, most of the results justify the development of multinational energy system models, in which the spatial coverage lays between national and continental models.},

However, the policy tools oriented to address this issue have received little research attention, particularly in the Global South. Thus, this research analyses the effectiveness of the social impact assessment (SIA) in Mexico's RE sector. In 2014 the government of Mexico introduced the SIA in response to the social conflicts around RE projects. The SIA has generated some favorable changes in the sector's social management. Yet, its effectiveness is constrained by diverse issues related to its institutional and regulatory design, government implementation, practices of companies and consultants, and restricted social involvement. Moreover, the sector's socio-technical arrangement (priorities, organization, experience, and policies) strongly influences the performance of SIAs and accounts for the lack of consideration of social aspects in project design and planning. We argue that without a substantial internalization of the social dimension in the priorities, policy, and planning of RE, the SIA would be limited to a problem-fixing role, which would constrain the effective management of social impacts.},

Despite this academic gap, Mexico has signed up for the United Nations SDGs, which include producing clean and affordable energy and reducing CO2 emissions to slow global warming. The country is, therefore, committed to implementing measures to help achieve these goals. This study is the first multidisciplinary analysis performed at a national level in Mexico, aimed at identifying sites for efficient Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) production while considering socioeconomic needs, environmental risks, and societal acceptance of the new technologies. We first calculated the energy potential from nearshore winds, waves, marine currents, and offshore thermal gradients. The results show that electricity needs are greater in the 11 states where levels of marginalization are highest. The production of MRE is feasible in three of these regions. However, because Mexico is home to significant natural coastal ecosystems and protected species, care is necessary to produce electricity while protecting Mexico's megadiversity. Social perception of the use of MRE is variable: the inhabitants of some locations are willing to accept the new technologies, whereas those in others are not. MRE production in Mexico is feasible but will face environmental and social issues that must be addressed before deploying new devices in the oceans.},

The increasing digitalization empowers several key opportunities for consumers' involvement and engagement in modern peer-to-peer interactive energy communities. Among them, blockchain technology is a timely innovation that is very promising. This paper explores the potential of a recently proposed power-sharing model suitable for building-scale energy communities and blockchain-based management to foster democratic perceptions and social acceptance in non-trusting end-users. Energy communities also benefit distributors in terms of increased demand flexibility, which can result in new methodologies for managing networks and increasing the hosting capacity of networks. The relationship between individual end-users in a community and among them and the distributor are crucial aspects.},

On the other hand, some states and municipalities have effectively banned new oil and gas drilling. In this paper, we examine how natural resource dependence, local economic conditions, and perceived economic benefits relate to support for restrictive oil and gas regulations in Colorado, US. Using representative survey data, our results suggest that perceived benefits, especially in the form of tax revenue, predict oil and gas policy preferences, while local and personal economic circumstances have little impact.},

The transition must take into consideration questions of energy justice to ensure that policies, plans and programmes guarantee fair and equitable access to resources and technologies. An energy justice framework is outlined to account for distributional, procedural and recognition inequalities, as well as emerging themes such as cosmopolitan and non Western understandings of justice, in decision-making relating to energy systems. The spectrum of research offers critical perspectives on the energy transition as well as tools for decision-making and policy processes. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods all contribute to our understanding of the problems and the success of responses. The studies presented in this special issue illustrate that the field of energy justice is a rapidly growing arena. There is constant innovation taking place in enabling the transition with new structures, processes and metrics being introduced to guide decision-making and a more holistic view of the community emerging where acceptance, mobilisation and empowerment are opening possibilities for a just transition to a low carbon energy system. The importance of introducing the interdisciplinary approach between social sciences and natural sciences as well engineering implementation supported by scientific data and experiments shall be emphasized in future studies.},

It is argued that stakeholder responses to renewable energy developments are, in part, related to interpretations of what both the technology and the location or `place' are seen to represent or symbolise. There is a need to move beyond knowledge deficit and NIMBY models if these issues are to be explored. Place was interpreted at different scales and was seen as: economically vulnerable, as having a sense of local ownership, as a resource and as nature. Symbolic interpretations of the technology related to the contested environmental status and significance of electricity produced, as well as it being seen as a project for local people, commercial, experimental, pioneering, industrial and at one with Mother Nature. These interpretations gave rise to various symbolic logics of opposition and support, some of which are outlined. Although a case study of a wave energy development, many of the issues discussed relate to renewable energy developments more widely. Therefore the findings are discussed in relation to their implications for renewable energy developers and UK energy strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The outcomes of the SEL assessments show which societal requirements have been met in current CCS developments and which ones should be improved for CCS deployment. They also show that monitoring currently is a regulatory requirement as part of permitting procedures, while it may alleviate community concerns on safety, provided that it has certain attributes.

This study is the first to look at the effect of exporting or importing CO2 on public perceptions. We conducted a fractional factorial survey experiment in Germany and Norway varying the nationality of the CO2 source and of the storage site of a hypothetical CCS project. We find that respondents from both countries do not evaluate offshore and onshore storage differently but otherwise we find substantial differences between countries. Norwegian respondents react to the experimental manipulation: despite an overall more positive attitude toward CCS, they evaluate a project where foreign sourced CO2 is stored in Norway substantially more negatively compared to a project where domestically sourced CO2 is stored in Norway. By contrast, German respondents are not affected by the variation of the nationality of emissions or the storage site. We connect this finding to construal level theory, arguing that Germans are more psychologically distanced from CCS than Norwegians due to differences in general familiarity with CCS and the political support for CCS; this makes them less sensitive to our experimental manipulation. The uncovered decrease in public support for CCS when CO2 is exported from Germany to Norway challenges the feasibility of the current plans of Northern European states for a CO2 transport and storage infrastructure.},

  abstract             = {Cost-efficient dispatchable renewable technologies are critical for enabling the energy transition towards 100% renewable generation. One promising example involves the integration of biomass boilers with concentrated solar power (CSP) referred to as hybrid concentrated solar biomass (HCSB) plants. This study evaluates the technical feasibility of a potential plant design for a rice-straw-fed HCSB plant. A case study for the Riverina-Murray region of Australia, a prime area for deployment owing to abundant solar and biomass resources is presented. Based on an assessment of different hybrid concepts, we investigate a solar-biomass hybridization with a concentrated solar tower system. With this hybrid concept, both the CSP and biomass boiler can raise steam to feed the high-pressure turbine enabling greater thermal efficiency. We evaluate HCSB plant performance at four scales: 5, 15, 30 and 50 MWe. Depending on size, HCSB plants reach thermal efficiencies from 21 to 34%. Considering the economic feasibility, assuming an internal rate of return (IRR) of 11%, viable deployment requires an electricity price of AU 120-350/MWh. The techno-economic assessment demonstrates advantages compared to standalone CSP plants and highlights the competitiveness of HCSB plants compared to other renewable technologies in Australia. The social and environmental impact assessment highlights additional benefits including local job creation and potential carbon emission mitigation.},

While energy digitalization is mainly governed by technological progress, the societal acceptance of such emerging technologies is essential for a successful energy transition. This study aims to identify critical challenges to IoT-enabled renewable energy use through the lens of the consumers. It attempts to analyze the challenges to implementing IoT effectively in emerging economies like India. The present study employs Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to classify 16 critical challenges into five main dimensions, using the responses obtained from 95 participants. Subsequently, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) prioritizes the identified challenges and organizes them into cause-and-effect groups based on their interactions. The findings indicate that technological challenges constitute the most critical cause barrier that affects other category barriers. Besides technology, challenges reflecting the social infrastructure have emerged prominently in this study. Thereafter, the analysis suggests that modifications to the structure, procedures, and technology are required to create capabilities and enhance the compatibility of IoT with RE applications. Further, proactive governance and reorienting market design are highlighted to foster emerging technologies and develop a robust regulatory framework. The insights from this study are pertinent for policymakers, regulatory bodies, and practitioners seeking to capitalize on the immense potential of this sector and expedite energy transactivity.},

  abstract             = {Access to energy provides numerous opportunities to enhance well-being and alleviate poverty. In rural and energy-poor areas, alternative technology solutions such as solar off-grid products, storage systems and energyefficient devices can complement the unreliable electric grid to fulfil energy needs. Localized entrepreneurship in rural areas can play a significant role in increasing energy access. However, studies on the dynamics of rural entrepreneurship and low-cost energy access in poor households are scarce. This paper explores the local entrepreneurs' perception of social, economic, and technological factors that impact entrepreneurship dynamics in rural poor communities of India, and to identify strategies to help further improve the existing institutional support. A community-based system dynamics (CBSD) approach was used to engage community members to understand their perspective of entrepreneurial development. The study participants were twelve local rural retailers in the state of Bihar in India who were previously trained and employed in a decentralized solar project, and have since become solar entrepreneurs. Participants were engaged in group model-building sessions to develop a causal loop diagram (CLD). Based on the basic structure identified in CLD, a simulation model was developed and calibrated using data from solar project operations and surveys of solar users and entrepreneurs. Results indicate that training and subsequent experience in the project and business helped reinforce the entrepreneur's skills. Repair service and sales of energy products contributed in building trust and awareness in the community, thereby increasing demand for solar and energy-efficient products. The simulation-based scenario analysis shows the positive impact of better business practices, bulk procurement, and continued repair services on the income of the solar entrepreneurs. Findings from this study can inform subsequent energy entrepreneurial development in rural Bihar.},

This systematic study aims to integrate and synthesize earlier research on the acceptance of RETs, assessing state-of-the-art and painting a complete picture of the consumer's adoption intention. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis on the topic of RETs acceptance have been conducted to understand the spectrum of theoretical and methodological methods used in the past, as well as how the users perceive and react to the adoption of it. Findings - The study of selected 70 research articles showed the role of technology, consumer acceptance and decision-making process as factors influencing the acceptance of RET. The findings suggest that it is crucial to comprehend these factors since users' opinions significantly affect the acceptance and use of renewable technologies. Practical implications - This paper reviews the research on adopting RETs and identifies factors influencing it. The study further endorses that technology like digitalization can promote the acceptability of renewable energy sources and, inadvertently, assist managers and policymakers in managing business models and making better decisions for sustainable investments. Originality/value - Research on accepting RETs by integrating the social and technological components is still in its infancy. This study is a novel attempt to identify broad patterns of RETs that can improve communication between decision-makers, technologists and users and aid in the switch to a sustainable energy transition.},

  abstract             = {The depletion of fossil fuels, economic concerns over the sharp fluctuations in oil prices, and environmental concerns including global warming have renewed interest in alternative green energy solutions in the form of renewable energy technologies. Solar energy is one of the most promising and environmentally friendly forms of renewable energy for power generation. However, energy transition towards renewables has been slow in developing countries, particularly in the oil-rich Arab Gulf countries. To assess the perspective of Omani consumers in terms of solar energy use, barriers, and readiness to use solar energy for sustainable development, this study aims to determine the proportion of the Omani population who use solar energy, the barriers to solar energy consumption in Oman, people's perceptions towards solar energy barriers, policies aimed at promoting solar energy programs, and the likelihood and willingness to use solar energy in the future. This analysis is based on quantitative data collected through a questionnaire survey distributed in Oman between 20 June 2023 to 12 August 2023. We used 113 samples for analysis using Principal Component Analysis and Krushkal-Wallis H-tests. Our results revealed that 95% of the residents and commercial units surveyed are willing to use solar PV in the future. The main barriers identified include high installation costs, high maintenance costs, and lack of awareness. The potential for growth in solar energy consumption and use depends on the capacity of the government to provide substantial incentives, financial support, improved quality, implement public-private partnership programs, as well as introduce a clear solar energy policy. While evaluating consumers' awareness and intentions to use solar energy in the future, this study offers practical implications for policymakers to forecast the potential growth, identify effective policy instruments for promoting renewable energy, and determine the readiness of the country for transition to cleaner energy consumption.},

  abstract             = {Farmers can play an important role in the critical renewable energy transition by generating solar energy. Farmers' adoption of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system results from a complex and interdependent array of technical, political, social, and economic factors. Under the regime of a covenant on energy and green-house gas emissions, the evolution of perceptions and responses to solar PV was monitored for a panel of 279 Dutch farmers in a unique series of surveys in 2015, 2018, and 2020. We observed that the will-ingness to reduce greenhouse gas emissions steadily increased from 35% of the farmers in 2015 to 82% in 2020, while the perceptions toward solar PV adoption among Dutch farmers fluctuated over this period. We examined Dutch farmers' determinants of solar PV uptake through multiple regression analyses. Consistent with the literature, our results indicate that behavioural intentions, the perceived importance of renewable energy, and farmers' innovativeness are the most critical determinants for solar PV adop-tion. Many farmers mentioned the decreased payback time as the most crucial motive to adopt solar PV. We argue that a stable long-term policy for renewable energy, as implemented in the Netherlands, creates attractive economic conditions for solar PV adoption. At the same time, the payback time is a crit-ical factor in shaping farmers' intentions and behaviour. We recommend more extensive research using panel datasets of farmers, while we also acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining high-quality panel data, which underlines the uniqueness of our analysis.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

The results highlight barriers such as the high initial cost, government-subsidized tariffs, bureaucratic processes and permits, ineffective regulations, limited awareness, lack of financing, distribution and operational network challenges, and insufficient government incentives. The proposed solutions suggest developing incentive policies to promote investment in PV microgeneration, training programs to enhance technical and cultural knowledge of solar energy, simplifying regulatory processes to facilitate project implementation, and providing accessible financing to reduce economic barriers. Additionally, the recommendations include the implementation of demonstration and outreach projects to showcase the feasibility and benefits of PV microgeneration, thus improving the social and technical acceptance of these systems.

A total of 63,762 units have been categorised according to the employed technology and produced energy: power plants for electricity production or cogeneration plants for combined heat and electricity production (53 plants) and thermal units for heat production (63,709 units). The eight regions of the area have noteworthy differences. In terms of electricity generated from solid biomass Calabria is by far the largest producer, followed by Apulia. Sicily, Sardinia and Molise provide lower amounts while Abruzzo, Basilicata and Campania generate almost negligible amounts. Regarding thermal production, Campania and Calabria are the largest producers, but Basilicata, Molise and Abruzzo generate the highest amount per capita. The area is far from fully exploiting its biomass potential, and there are also no district heating grids. Bioenergy can be remarkably competitive, provided that capital costs are relatively low and low-cost biomass is available, as it is the case of Italy. New applications and markets for sub-products (i.e., char, ash) would help in lowering the still not competitive economic indicators (LCOE).},

  abstract      = {Many countries, Switzerland included, envisage an energy transition characterised by the increased production of renewables. One challenge faced by these nations is that peak household electricity demand often does not correspond with the peak production of renewables such as photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Load-shifting via the use of smart appliances provides one option to better match renewable electricity production with household electricity demand. However, load-shifting requires the adoption of smart grid and smart metering technologies, which the public often views as a form of surrender to a lack of control and data security issues. Thus, load-shifting might encounter social disapproval. This paper analyses how control over the use of appliances and data security perceptions influence the social acceptance of load-shifting programmes via a social psychological online experiment (N = 250) by taking the example of the dishwasher. Results suggest a significant causal influence of the level of control over appliance on the acceptance of a load-shifting programme. In situations where participants perceived a lack of control over their appliance, acceptance levels dropped significantly. Regarding data security, experimental manipulation has been unsuccessful; therefore, no valid conclusions can be drawn regarding this factor. These results indicate the presence of serious concerns regarding the control of appliances when people are asked to consider a load-shifting programme. The development of a deeper understanding of these concerns may help utilities to create more successful, socially accepted load-shifting programmes and communication strategies.},

  abstract             = {The energy transition that Poland is facing directs investment and research efforts towards renewable energy sources (RES). This topic has gained importance due to environmental and climate reasons and, recently, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. All these issues affect the availability and prices of fossil fuels, on which electricity production in Poland currently depends. Therefore, to change the current state of affairs, it is necessary to turn to other sources of energy, including RES. Particularly high hopes are placed on prosumer photovoltaic (PV) technology. Therefore, it becomes important to study the factors of acceptance of this technology among the Polish society. The aim of this paper is to answer two research questions: (1) what factors shape intentions to invest in prosumer PV technology and (2) what factors shape attitudes towards this technology. The research was conducted using a questionnaire on a sample of 430 people. Data analysis was performed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that intentions are mainly shaped by attitudes towards PV technology and, to a small extent, by the media promotion of this technology. On the other hand, the factors shaping attitudes towards prosumer PV technology are environmental, economic, and those related to the perceived ease of use of PV technology. Social factors, in the light of the research conducted, do not influence attitudes towards the technology under study.},

  abstract        = {How African countries manage transitions to decarbonised, environmentally and socially acceptable energy systems is a topical issue in public policy, politics and academic spheres today. There is recognition that technology assessment plays a critical role in the choice of specific pathways to just clean energy transitions. Yet, there is limited energy technology assessment practice in Africa. In fact, technology assessment is not well understood and institutionalised. This, in part, is due to the absence of Africa context tailored technology assessment frameworks. This study used an integrated literature review to explore the state and forms of technology assessments and their relevance to energy technology assessment research. The review showed that diverse forms of technology assessments have evolved due to changing priorities in policy, methodological and practical aspects. We propose an action-oriented energy technology assessment that considers geographical contexts, sustainable development dimensions, and different energy systems as dynamic and fosters inclusive stakeholder engagement. The main output of our proposal is a 3-phased generic framework for conducting energy technology assessments. We conclude that the action-oriented perspective needs to consider a transdisciplinary approach to promote sustainable energy transition and evaluate the sustainability of different energy transition technologies in systemic socio-political and energy contexts.},

These controversies originate from a loss of public confidence in the decision-making process, lack of information about new technologies, and the desire of some promoters to avoid conflict. The lack of methodologies to structure each stage of the debate can, in this context, lead to the crystallization of the stakeholders' positions and to the failure of the project. To promote mutual understanding and constructive exchanges, this article presents a combination of methods based on psychosocial engineering principles to support debate and encourage stakeholders to participate with an openness posture. The method is based on a set of studies conducted as part of the ``Social Governance for Subsurface Engineering'' project and includes three stages: (1) develop stakeholders' knowledge so that they are able to participate in the debate with an informed viewpoint; (2) commit stakeholders to participate in the debate by adopting a posture conducive to constructive exchanges; and (3) structure exchanges between stakeholders through the use of cooperative methods facilitating the adoption of an openness posture.},

  abstract             = {In the face of mounting global climatic pressures, negative emission technologies (NETs) for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are increasingly proposed as necessary for meeting climate targets. While initial work has identified the potential of terrestrial NETs, a diverse set of marine/ocean-based NETs are gaining new and particular attention. Emerging studies on the feasibility of marine NETs are urgently needed, especially to explore the logics that public groups use to judge different approaches, and to ensure that design and governance of these technologies align with public values and priorities. This study explores factors of interest in understanding public views on four marine NETs, both perceptions of climate severity and urgency, and beliefs about marine environments. It uses a quantitative survey to explore how a representative sample of people in British Columbia, Canada and Washington state, United States evaluate four marine NETs: coastal restoration; ocean alkalinity enhancement; ocean fertilization; and offshore direct air carbon capture and storage. We find that perceived severity and urgency of climate change predicts greater comfort with all NETs studied, and views of marine environments as adaptable, fragile and manageable vary in predicting both greater and lesser comfort. Drawing upon these insights, the paper offers reflections on the conditional thinking linked with emerging views of marine NETs, concluding with methodological suggestions for future research on public perceptions as concerns the deployment of ocean-based CDR near and long term. Incorporating these insights into policy for ocean-based CDR will be important to ensuring responsible governance of these technologies.Key policy insightsIncorporating research on public perceptions will be important to the design of marine NETs and accompanying policies.Public groups in both British Columbia and Washington expressed high levels of comfort with coastal restoration, some comfort with offshore direct air carbon capture and storage, and some discomfort with ocean alkalinity enhancement and ocean fertilization.Perceived severity and urgency of climate change predicted greater comfort with all approaches; this evidence aligns with a small but growing body of scholarship indicating openness to environmental intervention amongst public groups concerned with climate impacts.Beliefs about marine environments, namely whether they are `adaptable', `manageable' or `fragile', also predicted comfort, suggesting that CDR in ocean contexts requires further examination regarding public perceptions.},

  abstract             = {Increasingly, the removal and durable storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide is understood as necessary to meeting targets to limit climate change. While research on technologies for `carbon removal' or `negative emissions' is growing, little of that work has attended to the social implications of these technologies, such as how carbon removal initiatives might be formulated in ways that align with public values and principles of justice and just transitions. In this paper, we draw upon involvement in early-stage research on offshore direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) to reflect upon these questions. We argue that (1) carbon removal's links and associations with extractive industries must be anticipated and that issues of distrust and operational oversight be addressed; (2) employment of `climate solutions' and `climate urgency' narratives require care and reflexivity so as not to overwhelm other considerations; (3) despite the apparent absence of people, offshore contexts must be understood and treated as social contexts with impacts to people and communities; (4) both onshore and offshore contexts require recognition of Indigenous jurisdiction, rights and title in project planning and design; (5) discussions of a just transition for carbon removal must go beyond attention to employment to address questions of infrastructure ownership, monitoring and governance. Drawing on these reflections, we offer a set of recommendations for early-stage carbon removal projects. Together, these suggestions offer a starting place for making carbon removal research and deployment more just and aligned with broader societal priorities.},

Development and deployment of green energy technologies offer a natural conduit to meet the growing electricity needs of the Association of Southeast Asian Economies (ASEAN) region while also serving as a viable strategy to adapt to climate change. The aim of this study is to formulate the policy lessons for the ASEAN economies and governments in facilitating the development and deployment of green technologies and alternatives energy options based on a specific case review of the ASEAN. The ASEAN economic region is prioritizing sustainable economic growth while minimizing the regional impacts of climate change through decarbonization. The study undertakes a case-specific analysis in reviewing green energy deployment in the context of green growth and energy transition using secondary data sources and discusses the current status and future options of renewable energy development in the ASEAN. We find that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will allow the ASEAN to continue to use fossil fuels while achieving sustainable economic growth as coal demand increases in the region. The deployment of CCS technologies will also act as an enabler of hydrogen energy as a green energy solution in the region in the longer term. Boosting public acceptance to nuclear energy, implementing energy efficiency improvement policies and eliminating fossil fuels consumption subsidies are feasible short-term and medium-term policies. Increasing both the public and private sector energy investments and development of CCS technologies in the longer term are necessary complementary policies to maximize the benefits of greater deployment of renewable energy sources in the region and combat climate change.},

Understanding features that persist across many cost-efficient alternatives enhances policy advice and acknowledges structural model uncertainties. We apply the modeling-to generate-alternatives (MGA) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement appear essential to keep costs within 10% of the optimum.},

Prior literature has focused much more on the institutional and policy factors than on the roles of citizens and their participation in such communities, and indirectly on sustainability. To address the lack, this study aims to explain the determinants of citizen participation in local energy communities by developing a research model grounded on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, and then through a mixed-methods design, study the impact of technological factors as a stimulus on more social outcomes, namely the organism and response behaviours. Our results highlight the strong impact of sustainable technologies and gamification in citizens' attitudes.

Such rapid and farreaching changes in the adoption of low-carbon technologies, lifestyle changes and labour relations require meaningful public engagement for policy to be both effective and equitable. But despite a large body of work on just transitions, there has been less attention paid to questions of citizen engagement in just transitions. In particular, the process of how and by whom social needs, priorities and demands are articulated and acted upon. While some research has mapped public participation on climate change, and there is a larger body of work on questions of social acceptance, there is a gap in our understanding of how citizen engagement with just transitions can be deepened and enhanced by drawing on experiences to date from other related and parallel processes. On one level, this neglect is unsurprising given the limited nature of processes explicitly designed to promote just transitions, such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JET-Ps) or experiences of national level dialogues and commissions, despite recent interest in the related use of climate assemblies to enable citizen engagement. But, we argue, there are significant lessons to be drawn for citizen engagement with just transitions from a long and rich experience of previous attempts to amplify voices, create spaces for citizen engagement, and build alliances to address justice issues across a range of struggles over resource pathways.},

  abstract             = {In 2019, solar energy made up the largest share of new electricity-generating capacity in the U.S. This growth is increasingly driven by large ``utility-scale'' projects. Although data from public opinion polls indicate an overall high level of support for `solar energy', generically framed, these polls rarely, if ever, consider the issue of scale of the proposed projects. This is a crucial gap: in response, our work explores public preferences for three distinct scales of solar energy. Support was measured with a mail survey implemented in three regions of Upstate New York during the fall of 2020. A total of 575 residents responded to the survey for a response rate of 18.4%. We find that support for utility scale solar is significantly lower than support for community or rooftop solar. The survey findings are complemented by fieldwork (interviews, public comments, editorials) which demonstrate that direct experience with utility development in or near one's community helps spur public discourse and the subsequent formation of better developed attitudes towards utility solar. Opposition to utility solar is more common among residents in Western New York, where development is the most active. Furthermore, many residents categorize utility solar as an industrial activity that would negatively impact the existing rural landscape. They furthermore question the need for such development when the same technology could be deployed on rooftops or other already developed spaces. We suggest that more pro-active attention to the scale of solar development is pertinent to understanding public responses and informing public engagement.},

  abstract      = {Background The availability of land for the installation of wind power turbines is restricted by numerous factors. Besides climatic conditions, the deployment of wind energy is limited by technical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Typically, assessments of land availability for wind power use legal and technical criteria to estimate the potential for wind power expansion. In contrast, we use observed characteristics of wind power generation sites existing in Austria and Denmark to estimate its potential expansion in Czechia. We combined data on wind turbine locations with data on land use, wind speeds, human impact on land, and nature conservation areas. Results Our analysis shows that the density of wind power in Austria is variable, but higher on average (4.79 MW km(-2)) than in Denmark (1.76 MW km(-2)). Austrian wind turbines have been installed in areas where the human impact on land is mostly higher than the Austrian average, while in Denmark, no difference is observed. Regarding the land use composite, the share of agricultural land on sites with wind turbines is on average much higher (86%), while the share of forest is much lower (7%) in both countries. We identified a maximum potential area in Czechia of 543 km(2) with Austrian and 421 km(2) with Danish characteristics. When conservatively assuming observed historical power densities, this area translates to 2295 MW and 741 MW of installed wind power capacity, respectively. These results are a magnitude of order lower than the potentials found in existing studies. In a sensitivity analysis, we have examined that the availability of potential sites depends mainly on the population density, the human impact on land, prevailing wind speeds, and the height above sea level. Conclusions We estimated available land area for potential wind turbine installations in Czechia using our newly developed methodology based on observed site characteristics of today's wind power infrastructure in Austria and Denmark. Available land area indicated possible overestimation of wind power capacities proposed in the recent studies on the renewable energy transition. Hence, more rigorous consideration of land availability is required for assessments of potential wind power expansion.},

The potential impact on decision-making can make media image a factor for technology market deployment, similar to technical, legal, and economic factors. Public acceptance tends to be shaped by how technologies are presented in the media. This study compares and analyses the media image of various power production technologies. Editorial and social media are analysed by using the M-Adaptive tool for media monitoring to obtain the media sentiment. The analysis is rather broad, including three million social media platforms and various news outlets in many regions and covering an enormous number of data points, from which this study has selected over 250,000 for further analysis with the help of artificial intelligence. The results indicate that public sentiment towards power production technologies varies among different technologies, and between editorial publications and social media. Editorial content is usually constructed by using news frames, whereas social media includes more emotional content from single users. A potential chain from media image to energy technology market deployment is suggested. The findings support the notion of social media having an increasing role in shaping public opinion, which may need to be acknowledged to a larger extent.},

  abstract             = {For countries like Norway, with abundant offshore wind resources and deep seas, floating wind power technology can play an essential role in the green energy transition. However, this technology is still immature, and the first utility-scale floating offshore wind power projects need substantial support for technology development to be commercially feasible. This study employs an online survey targeting the general population in Norway (N = 1011) to investigate support and opposition toward floating offshore wind power development. The survey includes a discrete choice experiment focusing on policy-relevant factors such as the export of electricity, reducing domestic carbon emissions by electrifying offshore oil and gas platforms, impact on global technology cost trends, and involving domestic offshore industries as key players in the floating offshore wind sector. We find the highest support for developing projects that utilize technology from domestic offshore industries and projects connected to the domestic electricity grid. Projects aimed at reducing domestic carbon emissions by electrifying offshore oil and gas platforms are favored over those for exporting electricity to other countries. A significant impact on future technology costs does not lead to increased support for the project. Projects presented after a framing text focusing on meeting future electricity demand result in a higher willingness to pay for floating offshore wind projects than those presented after a framing text focusing on meeting climate objectives. Respondents opposing all the projects are likely climate skeptics and believe that project developers should bear all the project costs. Norway is expected to play a critical role in developing floating wind power. However, the Norwegians demand clear national benefits to be willing to shoulder the cost of spearheading the floating offshore wind power development. Understanding these preferences is vital for crafting energy policies aligning with public interests and rapidly integrating floating wind power into the green energy transition.},

Consequently, diminishing the acceptance of offshore wind. Using a national sample (N = 872), we conduct a choice experiment to measure Norwegians' willingness to pay for new floating offshore wind. Explicitly, we investigate whether Norwegians' attitudes towards existing offshore industries affect their acceptance of this new technology. The analyses reveal that Norwegians' attitudes towards expanding oil and gas extraction, and aquaculture as well as their sociodemographic characteristics are robust indicators for their acceptance of floating offshore wind. Notably, young people and males are willing to pay more for floating offshore wind than older people and females. Additionally, positive attitudes towards colocating ocean aquaculture and shipping with floating offshore wind increase acceptance for the latter. Succinctly, people who are positive towards expanding aquaculture, tourism and shipping activities are willing to pay, 737, 557, and 480 Norwegian Kroner, respectively, to install new floating offshore wind before 2030. The impending projects will possibly utilize subsidies. Hence, investigating social acceptance of this technology provides useful insights for a seamless implementation.},

With a growing distance between agriculture and the public, communicating changes and fostering public acceptance as crucial factors for the success of these changes has become challenging. Therefore, understanding public attitudes towards emerging system changes in unfamiliar sectors helps identify appropriate communication strategies and provides information about possible responses from different stakeholders. To address the scarcity of studies on system changes in agriculture and their acceptability, a multidimensional evaluation of attitudes was undertaken using a factorial survey to test the utility of value-congruent information for enhancing positive attitudes. Electrical field cultivation (EFC) served as a case example for one potential energy system change in agriculture. The data were collected via an open scientific survey panel in Germany (N = 300) using a written vignette in the form of a newspaper article; different benefit foci and hypotheses were tested using path analysis. Although the different benefit foci did not reveal significant differences, problem awareness and knowledge were found to predict positive attitudes toward EFC. For once, results highlight the need to foster overall problem awareness for fossil fuels to garner public support for various pathways. Additionally, results underscore the perceived lack of personal affectedness by transition pathways as a barrier to responding to communication strategies, specifically in unfamiliar sectors such as agriculture. The study outlines the need for stakeholders to design communication strategies under consideration of fostering personal affectedness and overall problem understanding.},

The energy sector plays a significant role in this endeavor, contributing 76% of the world's total emissions. Considering electrification as an alternative promotes the deployment of technologies that use renewable sources, such as wind energy in coastal and offshore areas. In Colombia, wind energy alone has an accumulated technical potential of approximately 82 GW, mainly concentrated along the northeastern coast. Exploiting this technology enables the development of the national electrical system, reducing dependence on hydroelectric generation, strengthening the system against climate seasonality by ensuring supply security, environmental sustainability, and equitable energy access. Supported by system dynamics modeling, this paper presents four scenarios that explore possible futures for wind capacity deployment in Colombia between 2020 and 2050. It considers uncertainties in political and economic domains, as well as crucial national factors such as social acceptance, supply chain development, and transmission infrastructure. Favorable alignment of these factors towards wind diffusion could lead to nearly 29 GW of installed capacity by 2050, representing 40% of the projected total capacity of the electricity sector.},

These new paths are formed based on existing or novel resources that are often closely related to the social aspect. Hence, social acceptance and new path creation can be considered as mutually reinforcing processes that are crucial in energy transition. The study focuses on the use of agricultural biomass (or ``agrobiomass'') as a renewable energy source for heating and tries to investigate the interaction between resource formation processes during path creation, referring to knowledge creation, market formation, investment mobilization and technology legitimation, and social acceptance. A web-based survey with a sample size of 3,725 convenience-based responses from 22 European countries is used to generate the primary data for analysis. Two levels of social acceptance are used, focusing on the overall perceptions and the intention to install agrobiomass heating systems locally. Results indicate that knowledge creation acts as a booster for overall perceptions through awareness and public information, whilst existing knowledge and previous experience can increase the willingness to install agrobiomass heating systems. Regarding market formation, social acceptance is empowered by sourcing agrobiomass and technology through local farmers and manufacturers. Cost savings and positive local impacts are significant investment mobilization aspects, whereas agrobiomass initiatives supported by trusted organizations and/or companies act as significant technology legitimation channels for promoting social acceptance. Small variations exist between urban and rural areas showing that the territorial context matters. The study provides policy insights relevant to energy transition through the uptake of agrobiomass heating solutions.},

The options for carbon emission reductions are grouped into (1) generation of secondary energy carriers, (2) end-use energy sectors and (3) sector interdependencies. The challenges on the way to a decarbonized energy sector are identified with respect to environmental sustainability, security of energy supply, economic stability and social aspects. A global carbon tax is the most promising instrument to accelerate the process of decarbonization. Nevertheless, this process will be very challenging for humanity due to high capital requirements, the competition among energy sectors for decarbonization options, inconsistent environmental policies and public acceptance of changes in energy use.

Over time, Nunavik's residents have taken control of petroleum resources and their distribution, transforming this energy source into a major regional economic asset. Recently, there has been a transition towards renewable energy technologies (RETs) in Nunavik. However, are these alternative sources of energy appealing to local residents?

However, very few studies problematize perceptions and focus on the production of hydrogen. Hence, this study aims to bridge these theoretical and empirical gaps using a mixed-method approach based on semi-structured interviews (n = 7) and a questionnaire survey (n = 73) to understand stakeholders' perceptions of hydrogen production sources through a social construction of technology lens.ResultsThe findings suggest a tendency to favor hydrogen produced from renewable sources and to reject hydrogen produced from non-renewable sources. All the examined groups conform to this pattern. Their perceptions are based on prior knowledge of hydrogen technologies, with participants seeking information from specialized sources or from activities promoted by their organizations. Participants anticipate that hydrogen will be generated primarily through renewable energy sources and utilized where direct electrification is unfeasible. In addition, they envisage that the hydrogen economy will enhance energy democracy through representative participation in decision-making. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the topic is limited to certain social groups and kept away from the public eye. Furthermore, unlike the benefits, the perception of risk appears to have no impact on perceptions' construction. High confidence in science appears to minimize the recognition of potential risks and bolster the recognition of potential benefits. There is, however, a lot of uncertainty about the possible real impacts of the hydrogen economy.ConclusionsThere appears to be a collective perspective on hydrogen production sources, indicating the existence of social representations. Nevertheless, group attitudes and backing towards hydrogen vary. The participants identify hydrogen as a matter that remained unnoticed for over a decade, despite its prominent position in the policies and economic approaches of numerous countries. The topic has been relegated to third parties. This exclusion of civil society from decision-making may justify the NGO group's critical stance towards hydrogen. Moreover, it suggests that energy democracy, which is based on information dissemination and participation, is not being achieved.},

Although many people would consider this quickening pace good news, the transition from conventional resources has encountered public resistance. In this article I examine the nature of challenges to the development of geothermal, wind, and solar energy projects in three places: the United States, Scotland, and Mexico. The common thread in the public reservations about renewable energy is landscape change and the consequent disruption such change produces to established ways of life for those who are nearby. It also suggests the importance of rebalancing the emphasis of renewable energy programs away from the traditional technical focus that dominates development planning. The more suitable and expedient approach would be to consider the challenges of development as predominantly social matters with technical components, rather than the other way around. To accept this view is to unlock the door to a renewable energy future.},

Social acceptance research has neglected relations between socio-political and market acceptance, and the role of socio-spatial beliefs in legitimating technology deployment. This research addressed these gaps in two ways. First, we devised a novel methodology integrating participatory GIS in semi- structured interviews with government, energy industry and non-governmental stakeholders. Second, we investigated how socio-spatial resources- spatial imaginaries and imagined publics- are drawn upon by stakeholders to legitimate `acceptable' current and future pathways of low carbon energy technology deployment, using Sweden as a case study. Thematic analysis revealed consensus between government and industry stakeholders in `othering' two established, relational place imaginaries- `Northern Sweden' and `Southern Sweden'. Established place imaginaries were legitimated through historic, economic, demographic and environmental characteristics, and associated with specific imagined publics ('Northern People', `Indigenous Sami' and `Southern People') with varying levels of `acceptance'. An emergent place imaginary ('Mid-Sweden') focused on contestation over high voltage power lines. These socio-spatial resources were invoked to legitimate where future hydrogen deployment and offshore wind should be placed. Findings make four contributions. First, we extend understanding of the inter-relations between socio-political and market dimensions of social acceptance. Second, we develop a novel approach to social acceptance integrating the concepts of place imaginaries and imagined publics as socio-spatial resources. Third, we show how these socio-spatial resources can be captured using mapping methodologies. Finally, we map a future critical-spatial social acceptance research agenda.},

We argue that a first critical step in order to adequately address emotional responses to energy projects is to understand where these emotional responses come from. We introduce a value-based approach, which entails that different characteristics of energy projects may violate or support people's core values, which evokes emotions in people. We present a theoretical framework of the relationship between people's values, the (perceived) implications of energy projects for these values, and people's emotional responses to energy projects. We give examples from case studies in the literature to substantiate our reasoning, and we offer directions for future research.

Numerous clean cooking fuels are available but remain inaccessible to lowincome consumers due to affordability limitations. An emerging solution targeting the urban poor is pay-asyou-go (PAYG) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which allows gas to be purchased in micropayments. However, little is known about whether this technology can scale and foster widespread adoption of clean cooking. This study examines the state of the clean cooking market in sub-Saharan Africa and the role of PAYG LPG through semi -structured interviews conducted with n = 20 key informants including academics, donors and practitioners. The findings revealed perceptions of slow progress and tensions around the roles of LPG and electricity in the fuel mix. However, there was broad consensus that LPG will play some role in the transition in the short term. Respondents also revealed the multitude of challenges faced by PAYG LPG providers attempting to scale this technology at a time of increasing controversy about the role of fossil fuels in Africa `s energy transition. Nevertheless, participants described how PAYG LPG is an effective demand -side technology that makes clean cooking accessible to new consumers. Data collected by the meters offers opportunities to monetise impacts and target interventions at specific consumer groups. However, the unit economics are challenging and are compounded by a paucity of investment. Further research, dialogue and open debate between stakeholders is required to create a coherent enabling environment for PAYG LPG.},

Two key issues emerge from this review: only one sixth of the published applications on the relation between renewable energy and landscape make use of the ecosystem service framework. Secondly, the applications that do address ecosystem services for landscape planning and design lack efficient methods and spatial reference systems that accommodate both cultural and regulating ecosystem services. Future research efforts should be directed to further advancing the spatial reference systems, the use of participatory mapping and landscape visualizations tools for cultural ecosystem services and the elaboration of landscape design principles.},

  abstract             = {Safety and environmental risk go hand in hand with industrial development. However, it is unclear whether there is a linear or nonlinear relationship between risk and industrial development. Perhaps, it is case dependent. Some industrial endeavours such as offshore development, activities in a harsher environment, or development requiring new technologies (untested and untrusted technologies) may pose a higher risk (nonlinear) than more conventional industrial development activities (e.g., petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, pipeline transportation, and the like). Public perception plays a critical role in defining the risk versus development relationship. The public perception of risk is dependent on awareness and understanding of potential hazards and their likelihood of occurrence, and most importantly, effective communication of these along with the associated uncertainty. Public awareness can have a profound effect on the development of public policy, which in many cases is driven more by perception rather than by sound science. This paper sheds light on this crucial issue. It investigates two commonly used concepts of policy and decision-making, the Precautionary Principle (PP) and As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The paper provides a clearer understanding of both approaches with an illustrative example. It proposes a process to help readers understand where and when PP versus ALARP would be most applicable.

Following the microfoundations movement in strategy and Organizational Theory, the study combines insights from sensemaking research and Social Exchange Theory to delve into how cultural context influences individuals' perception of public-private collaboration for the energy transition and ultimately defines its nature. Drawing from a case study in Finland based on 30 interviews, we identify six critical dimensions in the actors' discourse: 1) the role of trust in decision-making, 2) consensus and competition, 3) horizontality, 4) boosting innovations versus the challenges of public and private sectors, 5) acceptability of arrangements and public funding, and 6) the role of public-private collaboration in the decarbonization. These dimensions shed light on the influence of the socio-cultural context in enhancing trust and consensus as drivers of social exchange in public-private collaboration. Future studies should explore 1) enabling mechanisms for cross-context collaboration and 2) the roles and motivations in collaborative approaches.},

  abstract             = {Due to anticipated energy shortages and the need to achieve climate goals, there is an urgent requirement for transition towards a green, resilient system of energy provision. This transition is hampered because important players in energy markets (governments and oligopolies), while supporting large-scale solutions, avoid or block systemic changes. This rejection of systemic change is strengthened by the dominant social paradigm, which ignores systemic vulnerabilities, treating resources as solutions and the environment as a sink. In its turn, the dominant social paradigm is contested by the new ecological paradigm and by attitudes towards sustainable business practices. Understanding this framework may be relevant for identifying decision-makers' perception of system risk, and thus for supporting a transition towards a more decentralized and resilient energy supply. In this context, this paper presents an empirical study among Polish students of a business university (N = 393), trying to discover the relationship between the social paradigms, perceptions of environmental resources and sinks, and systemic risk in large-scale energy production (i.e., nuclear power plants). Although the explained variance is limited, results show that various elements of the dominant social paradigm are related to problem denial. Technological optimism and belief in markets are predictors of optimism about resource shortages and neglect of system risk. This optimism is counteracted by political liberalism, and respondent attitudes towards sustainable business practices. Belief in market forces has an ambivalent effect, tempering technological optimism regarding nuclear energy but also political acknowledgement of the limited resources and sink capacities of the environment. Although the influence of the dominant social paradigm on energy transition can be identified, the results may indicate a decline in belief in market forces and liberal democracy, implying a rethinking of the dominant social paradigm may be needed. The existing relationship between these aspects warrants a critical review and discussion of the central role of the dominant paradigm in current management training. The results indicate that a lack of political liberalism and a negative attitude towards sustainable business practices amplify system risks in, e.g., large-scale nuclear energy projects.},

As the body of OSeMOSYS literature rapidly expands, it is essential to track research advancements to guide both current and future modellers. This paper presents a systematic literature review, exploring the applications, developments, and research trends related to OSeMOSYS over the last 10 years. The findings highlight a significant growth in OSeMOSYS-based research, with an annual increase of approximately 28 %, and most applications occurring in Africa and Latin America, though largely conducted by European institutions. Six key application areas were identified, such as capacity expansion planning in the power sector, transport sector planning, and sector coupling opportunities. Nine categories of complementary methods commonly integrated with OSeMOSYS were also categorized, including power sector performance, stakeholder engagement, and geospatial assessments. A thorough review of code enhancements demonstrates the framework's adaptability to various fields, such as flexibility assessment, hydropower systems, and storage modelling. Furthermore, seven key future research directions were identified: operational feasibility, uncertainty evaluation, temporal and spatial resolutions, technological detail, storage modelling, and macroeconomic impacts. This paper aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for modellers, analysts, and users, offering insights into research questions, complementary methods, available code enhancements, and potential future directions for the use of OSeMOSYS.},

  abstract  = {The domestic use of natural gas for heating is the prevalent option in the Netherlands. However, heat pumps will be mandatory in most Dutch households by 2026. Therefore, insights are needed in how citizens perceive this technology, by taking into account various societal, technological, economic, environmental, and political aspects. Our research offers a systematic investigation of the multiple viewpoints of heat pump users and their neighbors in Groningen, northern Netherlands. Using Q-methodology, we identified three distinct but interrelated and shared viewpoints: the realistic users, the hesitant neighbors and the enthusiastic advocates. All three shared viewpoints incorporate social influence and cognitive considerations, with the positive environmental impacts of heat pumps being highlighted in unison. Cognitive considerations relate mainly to technical and economic concerns. Social influence considerations often hint at the necessity of making prior agreements with the neighbors. We argue that the findings of this study can support policymakers toward the development of an integrated heat transition strategy.},

  abstract             = {Blue Energy (BE) is expected to play a strategic role in the energy transition of Europe, particularly toward the 2050 horizon. It refers to a set of Marine Energy Sources (MES), including offshore wind, waves, tides, marine currents, sea thermal energy, salinity gradients, and marine biomass, which are exploited by different BE technologies. Nevertheless, the implementation of integrated solutions to exploit MES in marine areas does not just concern technological issues; it requires inclusive planning practices considering different aspects regarding climate and environmental impacts, landscape compatibility, interference with other marine activities (such as shipping, fishing, and tourism), and social acceptance. A replicable BE planning framework has been developed based on interdisciplinary knowledge in three Mediterranean sites in Greece, Croatia, and Cyprus, under the scope of the Interreg Med BLUE DEAL project. It has been implemented by some interdisciplinary experts through a collaborative and iterative process of data elaboration, mapping, evaluation, and visualization. Results concern the localization of suitable sites to install BE plants and the estimation of potential energy production and avoided emissions in selected scenarios. Together with visual simulations, this study shows the potential effects of the implementation of BE in specific marine areas, with a special focus on the most promising offshore floating wind farms and wave energy converters (WECs), as basic information for participative design and stakeholder engagement initiatives, including public authorities, businesses, and citizens.},

  abstract             = {Hydrogen (H2) is a vital component of future decarbonized and sustainable energy systems. As an energy carrier, hydrogen can play a significant role in the security, affordability, and decarbonization of energy systems. Aquifers are the second-most economically-attractive option for geological hydrogen storage after depleted oil and gas reservoirs. For a successful storage project, a reasonably-high recovery of stored hydrogen is projected. Aquifers represent the most environmentally-friendly type of underground storage and are sometimes the only accessible geological formations for hydrogen storage. The selection of suitable storage sites is an inevitable step in the development of large-scale hydrogen storage operations. Storage sites should be selected based on sustainability, considering accessibility to the distribution system, the construction cost, environmental limitations, and legal and social requirements. Characterizing the mechanisms and parameters controlling the subsurface hydrogen transport properties is critically important for accurately assessing storage features and resolving hindrances toward the implementation of large-scale hydrogen storage. Research and demonstration programs are required to fully understand involved processes and their role in storage operations, design efficient injection and production strategies, and evaluate the po-tential hazards and the opportunities for their reduction. There is a crucial need for a dynamic regulatory framework and participation strategy facilitating large-scale aquifer storage. Hydrogen storage projects require a high level of safety regulations, especially for the leakage detection and monitoring, surface facilities, and op-erations - these are essential for designing a safe and efficient aquifer storage operation.},

In recent years, many forms of e-participation have emerged, and space for experiments with visual and interactive technologies has been created. However, research evaluating e-participation technologies in energy transitions is lacking. This study uses interviews with 33 stakeholders in a planned wind farm project, combined with online survey results, to derive empirical insights into attitudes towards and preferences for e-participation. On the one hand, we observe openness towards new options for creative input and visualization-based online tools and virtual realities. On the other hand, stakeholders fear vulnerabilities and are skeptical about the efficacy of online discourse. Institutional stakeholders primarily see risks in civic participation, while citizens themselves see the benefits. Unexploited potential for creative input, deliberation, and collaborative planning could be leveraged to increase democratic legitimacy. In this context, better outputs are not synonymous with accepting outcomes, but can include changes to or even rejection of plans based on public preferences and concerns. This potential remains largely untapped, however, and requires a willingness to participate, thus calling for mobilization strategies.},

The framework proposed that risks are amplified or attenuated by interested parties employing different rhetorical strategies to give information about risk a certain ``spin.'' The original literature identified four ``attributes of information.'' However, despite the longevity of the framework, these have not been explicated in detail. Here we add depth and clarity by examining how amplification stations send risk signals that amplify or attenuate risk by emphasizing these different attributes of information. Drawing on a wealth of qualitative data from two case studies of offshore wind turbine siting off the coasts of Maryland and Delaware and guided by an extensive literature review, we reveal the strategies interested parties are using to influence siting decisions and risk management. The paper explores the usefulness of SARF in organizing qualitative information and sharpening insights on participatory risk governance and the nuances of public responses to a relatively new low-carbon technology. The authors conclude that the framework is valuable for analyzing stakeholder information while also recognizing limitations that may be addressed with some targeted future research.},

In this paper, we argue that a focus on emotions can complement existing approaches for understanding the messiness and complexity of trade-offs households negotiate as they experience the process of purchasing, installing and using smart energy technologies. We explore emotional responses to a system of automated `smart' renewable storage designed to support the local electricity network trialed with thirty-four households on Bruny Island, in Tasmania, Australia. We integrate our focus on emotions with a relational-materialist theory of affordances which helps us to unpack the specific features of the technology - which may encourage, discourage, demand, refuse and allow certain household practices as well as trading energy from their battery for financial benefit. The institutional design of the technology delivery which involved minimal decision making power from householders had a significantly negative impact on the lived experiences of householders with the technology. Our focus on affect also revealed the stress and frustration experienced by householders who could not understand and control the technology in the way desired and in line with islander attitudes of self-reliance and autonomy. We can also learn from the positive emotions of enthusiasm, delight and satisfaction experienced by householders. We find affordances theory is a helpful approach for unpacking specific features of the system that provoke different, sometimes even contradictory, responses, yet also suggest refinements to the theory to incorporate the context in which the technology comes to be in people's lives.},

Social acceptance is a decisive factor in the successful implementation of geothermal projects.Main textThis systematic review summarizes the major aspects and evaluates the crucial outcomes of recent research on community acceptance as a dimension of social acceptance of geothermal technology since 2011, on a global scale. From the literature, we identified and grouped researched acceptance factors into five main acceptance categories, namely `project organization and process', `environment', `municipality', `technology', and `governance'. Each category comprises a number of specific acceptance factors addressed by different survey methods (e.g., interviews, questionnaires, content analyses) in the relevant publications. The acceptance factor categories `technology' and `governance' are remarkably underrepresented, whereas the acceptance factors combined in the categories `project organization' and `municipality' are frequently mentioned in the literature. Acceptance factors combined within the category `environment', `trust in key actors', and `information about the project' are expectedly the most dominant ones in the papers studied. Interestingly, acceptance categories and number of mentions of acceptance factors are comparable in all survey methods applied in the various studies. Besides the acceptance factors combined in the categories `environment' and `project organization and process', `knowledge about geothermal technology' (an acceptance factor from the category `municipality') represents the predominant acceptance factor of geothermal technology.ConclusionsDeeper knowledge, in particular about the technical aspects of geothermal energy generation, might enable a more comprehensive and holistic view on geothermal technology. Furthermore, the integration of all relevant groups of stakeholders in the process of implementation of geothermal projects strongly influences their social acceptance. Following the results of our systematic literature review, we propose these aspects should be addressed in more detail in future research on the community acceptance of geothermal technology and energy production.},

We analyse new flexibility assets such as electricity storage, heat pumps, demand-side response with existing wet appliances, electric boilers for domestic hot water and distribution grid expansion, along with energy efficiency measures in electrical appliances and building retrofitting. We propose an open-source sector coupling model (GRIMSEL-FLEX) to minimise, from a social planner perspective, the total cost of the energy system for electricity and residential heating supply in Switzerland, including various types of consumers and urban settings. We find relevant feedback mechanisms among various flexibility options. Firstly, electric boilers have a larger flexibility potential than demand-side response with wet appliances since they reduce storage investments by more than 26% by 2050 (only 12% for demand-side response). Secondly, 34% more electricity storage is needed if heat pumps replace all fossil -based heating and 80% to replace all heating systems entirely. Thirdly, we find a shift in the operation of heat pumps, electric boilers and wet appliances from night to midday, resulting in larger photovoltaic deployment (22%-66% for the residential sector). Finally, electricity storage capacity induced by heat pump deployment is highly dependent on the retrofitting rate. With 1% per annum, 86% of storage investments can be avoided and it can be counterbalanced with a high retrofitting rate of 2% per annum.},

Corporate decision makers act as both facilitators and barriers to the introduction of technologies into their organisations. Psychological factors clearly have an impact on their decisions and acceptance behaviours, but these have not been fully explored. Consequently, an understanding of these factors is essential for organisations who wish to accelerate technology adoption as well as for innovators who face numerous barriers when introducing their new products to the industrial market. The upstream oil and gas (O&G) industry has been characterised as reluctant to adopt new technology. The analysis of three technology introduction case studies in the UK offshore O&G sector (including interviews with 22 personnel involved in developing and commercially buying new technology) confirmed the influence of 15 psychological factors on organisational technology adoption decision making. These have been organized into a framework (P-TAF) consisting of six categories of psychological constructs, namely: personality, attitudes, motivation, social, cognitive, and organisational factors. With further development, this preliminary framework can be used to develop interventions that support the successful technology uptake in O&G and in other sectors experiencing resistance to the introduction of new technology.},

  abstract             = {Energy transitions are at the top of global agendas in response to the growing challenges of climate change and international conflict, with the EU positioning itself as playing a pivotal role in addressing climate risks and sustainability imperatives. European energy transition policies identify `smart consumption' as a key element of these efforts, which have previously been explored from a predominantly technical perspective thus often failing to identify or address fundamental interlinkages with social systems and consequences. This paper aims to contribute to interdisciplinary energy research by analysing a forward looking `Horizon Scan' research agenda for smart consumption, driven by the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Reflecting on an extensive systematic Delphi Method exercise surveying over 70 SSH scholars from various institutional settings across Europe, we highlight what SSH scholars see as future directions for smart consumption research. Building from seven thematic areas (under which are grouped 100 SSH research questions), the study identifies three key `shifts' this new smart research agenda represents, when compared to previous agendas: (1) From technological inevitability to political choice, highlighting the need for a wider political critique, with the potential to open up discussions of the instrumentalisation of smart research; (2) From narrow representation to diverse inclusion, moving beyond the shortcomings of current discourses for engaging marginalised communities; and (3) From individual consumers to interconnected citizens, reframing smart consumption to offer a broader model of social change and governance. Social Sciences and Humanities scholarship is essential to address these shifts in meaningful (rather than tokenistic) ways. This agenda and the shifts it embodies represent key tools to enable better interdisciplinary working between SSH and teams from the technical and natural sciences.},

In Colombia, the energy matrix is predominantly fossil-based (76%), with hydroelectric power accounting for 70% of electricity generation. However, renewable energy sources only contribute 2% to the national energy mix. To reduce emissions by 20% by 2030, Colombia has presented an energy transition roadmap. The need for bioenergy production in Colombia arises from the residual biomass availability, the potential to provide sustainable energy access, and the potential to mitigate climate change impacts, while addressing energy poverty and enhancing energy security. This study presents an overview of biogas production in Colombia, emphasizing the need for financial resources to overcome barriers. Policy incentives, awareness campaigns, and research and development play a vital role in fostering social acceptance, technology adoption, and optimizing biogas production processes. Collaborative efforts among the government, private sector, and local communities are recommended to ensure wide-scale adoption of biogas, promoting economic, social, and environmental sustainability. By enabling informed decision-making, this research supports the transition to renewable energy sources and the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on bioenergy. The aim of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with biogas production in Colombia, including technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects, and provide recommendations for promoting its sustainable implementation and widespread adoption in the country.},

By combining insights from TIS and from organization studies, we provide theoretical and empirical underpinnings to `legitimacy', a concept often defined superficially and mapped at an aggregate, national level. We add a spatial perspective by comparing dimensions of legitimacy between two heterogenous regions in Germany. They have similar diffusion trajectories of wind energy but differ in structural features (socio-economic factors and TIS elements). To capture place-specific institutions and dynamics influencing regional legitimacy, we focus on decision makers and their perception of the TIS. Even though politicians and civil servants are crucial for wind development in their constituent regions and are thus important contextual actors to the TIS, their perspective has been mostly neglected. Applying a comprehensive, mixed methods approach, we conducted an online survey among these decision makers and complemented the insights with qualitative expert interviews. Our analysis shows that pragmatic and moral dimensions of legitimacy are particularly susceptible to place-specific influences. These spatially sensitive insights have been missing from the debate on legitimacy so far and might inform policy directed at advancing technological legitimacy in certain regions.},

Techniques based on systematised scoping reviews and bibliometric analysis were used to examine the typology, theme, trend, temporal and spatial dimensions, impact, and methodologies of 285 articles. The results indicate that the literature is divided into nine thematic areas, grouped into three clusters that have evolved differently over time. Articles on this matter receive a high level of citations and impact metrics. Furthermore, some countries receive more attention than anticipated, and wind energy is the most prominent source. Researchers often employ quantitative methods, such as logistic regression, using data collected from surveys. Finally, this study identifies possible directions for future research, focusing on aspects that must receive more attention.},

Since literature review has shown that no game about DH exists, the concept of a serious game about a heat supply system and its transformation from a fossil fuel-based system to a renewable-based one is introduced in this work. The first results of the game development are presented, namely, initial conditions, gameplay, the model of heating sector and the model of the DH transformation. The game will allow players to explore interdependencies between technical, economic, ecological and sociopolitical aspects as well as among different stakeholders (producers, consumers, government) and develop strategies for a successful transformation. The flexibility of different transformation scenarios and the influence of boundary conditions on the transformation can be analyzed after playing the game multiple times. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract             = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an inevitable action to achieve CO2 emission reduction targets including becoming net-zero by 2050. Increased efforts are therefore required to identify suitable locations for large-scale CO2 storage. In addition to large aquifers, shut down oil and gas fields in the North Sea are logical candidates for offshore large-scale CO2 storage because of their proven storage capacity, reliable caprock integrity, established infrastructure, and public acceptance. However, in some cases, old and legacy wells are subject to high uncertainties in their integrity, and they can compromise CO2 containment in such reservoirs. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), such wells are numerous even outside of oil and gas production areas, i.e., legacy wells affecting aquifers. Therefore, there is a clear need for reliable and cost-effective technologies for well integrity evaluation and remediation. This paper discusses a workflow for screening, monitoring, and remediation of legacy wells. In a first stage, the screening of the Horda Platform areas suggested the need for integrity investigation for the exploration well 32/4-1 T2, drilled into the Alpha structure of the Smeaheia fault block if CO2 is stored in the structure. Our initial well screening of drilling documentation indicates that the well is not suitable to be reused for CO2 injection and geophysical monitoring is recommended. In a second stage, a numerical representation of the well architecture is built including realistic geological setting. We evaluate the sensitivity of non-invasive low-frequency electromagnetic monitoring to corrosion levels in the casing. Numerical end-member simulations of assuming casing corrosion of different degrees by changing material conductivity are performed. Results comparing different corrosion scenarios with a base case (no corrosion) give an above noise signal at receiver locations enabling to separate the different cases. Comparison of the gained electrical fields at seafloor suggests that well casing corrosion monitoring should be possible. Finally, the electrochemical deposition potential of the Sognefjord Formation water is analyzed, revealing depositional potential for portlandite, which might be useful for cement remediation. We recommend such an analysis for all legacy wells penetrating candidate reservoirs for future CO2 or hydrogen storage.},

Realising these ambitions requires concerted, often innovative, political action across several policy domains. To understand the unique political challenges facing offshore wind deployment, this article presents a case study of the Republic of Ireland, where decades of sporadic political ambition to support offshore wind energy has not yet translated into commercial deployment. We use the Multiple Streams Framework to guide data collection, 29 elite interviews and extensive documentary analysis, and offer an historical explanation for why political actors did not meet long-standing market ambition. We analyse the battle of ideas between alternative policy approaches that emerge through distinct policy networks and institutions spanning marine planning, grid development, and energy price support. In Ireland, two key drivers restrained political support for offshore wind for over a decade: competition with onshore wind for limited grid connection capacity and resilience, and calibration of policy instruments to attain decadal renewable energy target at least cost. The study shows the value of a deviant case to demonstrate the political complexities of developing and adopting technology-specific policy instruments to support offshore wind energy in the context of long-term climate change targets, grid development, and grid system services plans.},

  abstract      = {Carbon capture (i.e., CO2 capture) and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are recognized as potential pathways to combat global climate change. Numerous efforts are underway, such as CCS (e.g., biochar used for soil amendment; captured carbon injected into onshore or offshore reservoirs) and CCU (captured CO2 used for crop/algae production), due to enormous societal, economic and environmental concerns on climate change and for complying with emission regulations as well as meeting the committed emission reduction targets. This study compiled information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction initiatives, including CCS and CCU on the earth, recent technological advances in CCS and CCU, and their economic, environmental and societal implications. The prospect of CCS and CCU technologies has also been discussed. CCS processes require less energy compared with CCU and thus tend to be more cost-effective than CCU. The global warming potential (GWP) and the cost of energy systems that deployed CCS/CCU varied from 0.007-0.225 kg CO2 eq per MJ and 0.017-0.070 MJ-1, respectively. Both CCS and CCU have challenges, and public perception of these initiatives seems to be complex or not satisfactory for deploying large-scale projects, which hinders meeting the GHG emission reduction targets of different jurisdictions. The acceptance of CCU seems to be higher compared to that of CCS because of the concerns about land-use complexities. For a carbon-neutral economy, a single transition pathway appears to be inadequate. Stringent policies, financial incentives/benefits, stakeholder participation and technological advances would be crucial for the transition; however, technological advances and policy initiatives must be justified by a broader sustainability check to avoid the risk of investment and climate change. CCUS have gained attention to combat rising climate change challenges. Transdisciplinary approaches are required for deploying large-scale CCUS projects. Acceptance of CCU seems higher than CCS while CCS is cost-effective compared to CCU.},

Despite all its promise, U.S. marine aquaculture production is tiny relative to its potential. The constraints often cited are lack of social license, an inefficient and uncoordinated permitting system, and the absence of supportive government programs similar to those enjoyed by terrestrial agriculture. National commissions have noted these constraints for more than 30 years. The paper first outlines key policy drivers prompting a reevaluation of US marine aquaculture policy (human health and nutrition, climate change, and market disruptions caused by the coronavirus) and then focuses on three critical policy goals that could contribute to expanding U.S. seafood farming: improve public understanding and acceptance, enhance the efficiency and timeliness of the aquaculture permitting process, and expand economic incentives to foster aquaculture development.},

The results showed high acceptance rates for solar farms as well as a considerable potential for protest and opposition against wind farms and high-tension power lines. In addition, subset correspondence analyses showed that all four acceptance types are embedded in consistent energy-related perception patterns. The results are of particular relevance for social science research in the field of acceptance of energy technologies as they empirically illustrate the high complexity of energy-related perception patterns.},

Public perception and acceptance of a changing energy landscape are crucial for enabling a hydrogen economy in Germany. The societal discourse surrounding hydrogen imports carries significant importance as it provides a lens through which to assess the alignment of these developments with Sustainable Development Goals and justice principles. This study sheds light on potential synergies or conflicts resulting from socioeconomic implications of hydrogen imports. With a multimethod approach, media discourses and public perceptions of hydrogen import are assessed. This study presents results from a media analysis of N = 37 newspaper articles and a representative survey (N = 2752). Media representation of hydrogen imports focuses on discussed motives for imports and conditions for partnerships with potential countries, whereas implications for exporting countries receive little attention. The survey results on public perceptions of Power-to-X technologies show support for renewables as a basis for imports. Yet, there is still a high degree of uncertainty in the assessment, expressed by a high number of ``don't know'' answers within the survey. The study highlights the need for stronger science communication and dialogue on hydrogen import strategies. This study aims to examine the public discourse of hydrogen imports through the energy justice framework in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals by identifying the media discourse on the topic of hydrogen imports and measuring public perceptions. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of hydrogen import.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH},

In terms of implementation of CCS, the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) perception on CCS influenced opinions, while about half of the respondents did not have clear opinions on a hypothetical plan of implementing offshore CCS near their home. Respondents were categorized to four groups, who were consistently positive, consistently negative, changeable or fundamentally indifferent to CCS, and the points of communication for each group were discussed to get a consensus on CCS policy and implementation. The survey found that some of the characteristics of indifferent people toward CCS had a low level of consciousness regarding concerns on climate change issues and politically passive on national political issues. Required information to communicate CCS issues for each group were identified by the analysis. The results of our analysis highlighted the importance of informing the Japanese general public about the technological maturity, positive and negative impacts or risks of CCS, and the necessity of climate change mitigation action in communicating the issues surrounding CCS implementation.},

Factors are identified using content analysis.FindingsResults suggest high levelized cost of energy as the most discussed challenge for the growth of OWE. Insufficient financial support and policy, initial capital and inadequate technology formed the second, third and fourth most discussed challenges respectively.Research limitations/implicationsTo reduce the cost of OWE, the distribution companies in India could adopt feed-in tariffs (FiTs) in the early stages of development and make OWE procurement mandatory. The renewable purchase obligation (RPO) in India is specific to solar and non-solar; policy should accommodate offshore wind-specific RPO targets for each state to reach the 2030 target of 30 GW from OWE.Practical implicationsTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the challenges of OWE development from a global perspective and portray these major challenges in the Indian context and uses content analysis from the existing literature to ascertain the major roadblocks for the development of OWE.Originality/valueThe study identifies the unexplored gap in literature that includes futuristic challenges for OWE from climate change.

This does not only involve the visual character but also meanings that are assigned to these landscapes, which together influence the perceived landscape quality. The research is based on a representative online panel survey of Swiss residents (n = 1062). A discrete choice model (15 choice tasks) was implemented to estimate people's preferences for different REI scenarios across several landscape types. Hierarchical Bayes analysis allowed us to determine preferences of the different respondents, while choice simulation allowed us to estimate preferences for every potential scenario (n = 224) of the discrete choice experiment. While the results show a heterogeneous picture of people's preferences, they also reveal common general patterns. Near natural, mid/high-elevation landscapes in the Alps are clearly rejected for REI implementation. Landscapes dominated by settlements or intensive agricultural use and landscapes in mountain tourist areas are preferably selected for REI developments. REI scenarios including overhead power lines perform consistently lower than scenarios without power lines. Overall, high preferences for scenarios with low REI indicate that society still lacks awareness of the need for massive REI implementation to achieve a sustainable energy transition.(c) 2022 The Authors.

  abstract             = {It is often claimed that marine renewable energy alone could meet the electricity demand of current and future human societies. However, such claims are based on highly uncertain estimations of the global potentials of marine renewable energy sources (including tidal, ocean currents, wave, offshore wind and salinity and thermal gradients), and do not take into account the embedded energy of current technologies. To better understand the effective potential of marine energy, we conducted a literature review of its gross, technical, economic and sustainable potentials, as well as the energy return on investment (EROI), and estimated the net energy potential. We found that all marine technologies could provide a maximum energy surplus of 57,000 TWh/yr. This figure goes down to similar to 5000TWh/yr when excluding offshore wind. The previous figures do not include the contribution from ocean currents, for which no reliable estimates of global potentials and EROIs could be obtained. Due to its high upfront costs and environmental impacts and low social acceptance, no additional tidal range capacity expansion is envisioned. Similarly, the combination of a low sustainable potential and the low EROI makes the large-scale exploitation of salinity gradients unlikely with current technologies. Including all technologies, the average EROI of marine energy is similar to 20, but excluding offshore wind reduces the average EROI to similar to 8. While we did consider sustainability constraints for some marine energy sources, our estimation of marine net energy potential primarily relied on technical factors and did not account for economic and legal constraints. Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as an upper bound for the actual net energy contribution of marine energy sources to the global energy mix.},

  abstract  = {The excessive combustion of fossil fuels for energy provision have altered natural planetary functions, resulting in adverse biophysical and societal implications. Such implications have prompted many governments globally to advocate for the adoption of renewable energy systems in order to reduce GHG emissions. While renewable energy technologies such as solar and biogases have been thoroughly researched and deployed, tidal current turbines (TCTs) that harness kinetic energy from the lateral movement of the tides are a comparatively emerging renewable energy technology, and thus has received relatively less attention with respect to their potential to supplement the renewable energy transition. This paper examines the physics behind tidal movements and cycles, and the technological operation of TCTs. Environmental impacts and economic barriers are analyzed. Best practices of MSP from world leading nations are examined, along with current deploy-andmonitor-consenting regimes of TCT test facilities. An optimal TCT design is suggested based on a synthesis of information from proceeding sections. Finally, an analysis of the implementation of TCTs in Canada, China, and Norway is presented, the results of which demonstrate that harnessing the accessible and sustainably extractable resource of each nation can result in an aggregate installed capacity of 9076 MW through the deployment of 7564 TCTs at a cost of 5,740,964,430, thereby creating 14,467 jobs. This would produce 29,829,711 MW h/yr of electricity sold at approximately 22 cents/kWh, eliminating a total of 14,914,855,258 kg of CO2e, approximately 0.1%. of the projected global electricity demand for 2016.},

Failure to sufficiently address the concerns of external stakeholders could continue to hamper deployment. Here, we use a multi criteria model to assess all possible sites in a 2 km x 2 km grid of all potential locations in continental US federal waters, contrasting the perspectives of developers and other stakeholders. Our model elucidates how developers and policymakers could better approach future deployment. First, while developers prefer larger plants, we find that these facilities are more fragile-they are sensitive to location, and their impacts are more uncertain than smaller plants. Second, there is 600 GW of capacity where both developer and stakeholder interests align-developing these locations should be prioritized. Third, there are few areas on the US West Coast where developer and stakeholder preferences align, suggesting a need to reduce stakeholder-plant interactions or locate facilities in deeper waters than current technology allows.},

  abstract             = {BackgroundMorocco is facing major challenges in terms of its future energy supply and demand. Specifically, the country is confronted with rising electricity demand, which in turn will lead to higher fossil fuel import dependency and carbon emissions. Recognizing these challenges, Morocco has set ambitious targets for the deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity generation (RES-E). The realization of these targets will lead to a fundamental transition of the Moroccan electricity sector and requires substantial public and private investment. However, different risks constitute barriers for private RES-E investments and lead to high financing costs, which may eventually discourage capital-intensive RES-E projects.MethodologyWhile the existing literature has mainly focused on assessing the impact of financing costs on the economic competitiveness of individual technologies, the aim of this research is to assess the techno-economic feasibility of different electricity generation portfolios. To recognize the social dimension of the sustainable energy system transition, the electricity scenarios for Morocco have been jointly developed with stakeholders in a scenario building workshop in Rabat, employing a downscaled version of the open source electricity market model renpassG!S, augmented by a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) module.ResultsIn the stakeholder workshop, four different electricity scenarios for Morocco were co-developed. Each of these scenarios describes a consensual and technologically feasible future development path for the Moroccan energy system up to 2050, and comprises conventional fossil fuel-based technologies, as well as RES-E technologies in varying shares. Employing the downscaled renpassG!S model, we find that total system costs, as well as average levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced substantially with low-cost financing.ConclusionsOur results indicate that de-risking RES-E investments can lead to cost competitiveness of a 100% RES-E-based electricity system with mixed-technology scenarios at marked financing costs. Therefore, we identify specific de-risking recommendations for Moroccan energy policymaking. In addition, we argue that participatory scenario modeling enables a better understanding of the risk perceptions of stakeholders, and can eventually contribute to increasing the political feasibility of sustainable energy transition pathways.},

  abstract             = {Cost optimal scenarios derived from models of a highly renewable electricity system depend on the specific input data, cost assumptions and system constraints. Here this influence is studied using a techno-economic optimisation model for a networked system of 30 European countries, taking into account the capacity investment and operation of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation, transmission, and different storage options. A considerable robustness of total system costs to the input weather data and to moderate changes in the cost assumptions is observed. Flat directions in the optimisation landscape around cost-optimal configurations often allow system planners to choose between different technology options without a significant increase in total costs, for instance by replacing onshore with offshore wind power capacity in case of public acceptance issues. Exploring a range of carbon dioxide emission limits shows that for scenarios with moderate transmission expansion, a reduction of around 57% compared to 1990 levels is already cost optimal. For stricter carbon dioxide limits, power generated from gas turbines is at first replaced by generation from increasing renewable capacities. Non-hydro storage capacities are lily built for low-emission scenarios,in order to pro-vide-the necessary flexibility to meet peaks in the residual load. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It presents the definition and model results for a set of mitigation scenarios for Germany that achieve 85% CO2 emission reduction in 2050 relative to 1990. During consecutive dialogues, civil society stakeholders from the transport and electricity sector framed the definition of boundary conditions for the energy-economy model REMIND-D and evaluated the scenarios with regard to plausibility and social acceptance implications. Even though the limited scope of this research impedes inferential conclusions on the German energy transition as a whole, it demonstrates that the technological solutions to the mitigation problem proposed by the model give rise to significant societal and political implications that deem at least as challenging as the mere engineering aspects of innovative technologies. These insights underline the importance of comprehending mitigation of energy-related CO2 emissions as a socio-technical transition embedded in a political context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {In media coverage, the context of the German energy transition, also referred to as Energiewende, casts a spotlight not only on various technology options (e.g. wind or coal power) but also on more abstract topics such as security of supply or electricity prices. Thereby, the public's assessment of energy-related issues may greatly rely on perceived risks. Focusing on the quality of energy-related risk reporting, this contribution therefore is intended to explore the German print and TV media discourse on energy options or topics. In our sample, one in three articles connects an energy option or topic with an evident or potential unwanted event. Although the media's effect on actual risk perception involves some controversies, researchers tend to criticize the media as being susceptible to framing and for failing to place unwanted events in perspective, e.g. by not presenting the corresponding likelihood of occurrence, which is necessary to define risk. If this critique holds true, accurate public risk assessment is partly hampered because media coverage implies uncertainty rather than providing all information available. We examined seven indicators of quality reporting derived from literature research: intensity, likelihood, controllability, desired uncertainty, sensationalism, emotional language, and type of unwanted event. Based on German energy media coverage in 2013, we found a relatively high occurrence of intensity and controllability, whereas likelihood and desired uncertainty were reported less often. By aggregating the indicators into a risk-reporting quality index, we did not observe a poor quality of risk reporting on energy issues. In contrast to previous research, the overall quality of energy-related risk reporting can be assessed as at least moderate, implying that the media depicts risks more precisely than assumed. The occurrence of quality indicators thereby significantly depends on the type of unwanted event rather than on the energy option considered.},

While energy production and consumption are to be oriented towards renewable energies, ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture is also a target for science and society. Due to the expansion of renewable energies, agricultural land in particular is the focus of various interest groups, from food production to energy production. In this interdisciplinary study, we show the opportunities and limits of joint synergies from the nexus of food production, energy production, energy consumption, biodiversity protection and social acceptance of renewable energies in a scenario. Biodi-versity agriphotovoltaics, i.e. agriphotovoltaics in combination with biodiversity protection measures, such as flower strips, can make a valuable contribution to promoting biotope connectivity in addition to significant energy production. We show this in a GIS-based regional assessment for Lower Saxony in northern Germany. This rough spatial assessment is followed by a modelling of energy production and consumption during the cultivation of a characteristic agricultural field in the loess region of Lower Saxony. Our focus here is on the possibilities of using cable electricity or battery storage for carrying out the cultivation. In an accompanying survey of farmers regarding the use of agriphotovoltaics, we collected and evaluated their prior knowledge, experiences, and at-titudes towards this technology. Finally, we show which advantages agriphotovoltaics and electrified agricultural machinery can also have for the sustainable transformation of agriculture and which challenges exist for a truly sustainable use of these technologies.},

Slow electricity grid extensions, restrictions in public perception as well as limited transformation progress in other sectors beside electricity cause major drawbacks in greenhouse gas mitigation. Power-to-X (PtX) technologies may be the missing link for a more resilient energy transition and provide both, renewable substitutes for fossil fuels as well as electricity grid balancing services owing to flexible operation and long-term storage abilities. Different PtX concepts proved operability in several worldwide distributed pilot projects. However, little is known yet about potential technical, monetary, societal and resource related scale-up limitations. In this paper, implications of these aspects for a large-scale energy system implementation are shown. From a technical perspective the concept of long-term flexible PtX operation modes is generally feasible and could become key for a more resilient future energy supply. However, economics are still the bottleneck for an extensive diffusion: in two scenarios for 2050 PtX may cause additional national annual energy costs between approx. 10 and 100 billion euros compared to an ongoing fossil fuel supply at current price conditions. Nevertheless, such expenses can be considered as reasonable in contrast to expenses for the compensation of climate change consequences of a future fossil fuel-based energy system.},

Studies on acceptance of hydrogen technologies have resulted in neutral to positive evaluations. This paper extends previous studies by focusing on large-scale hydrogen infrastructure. Within the project ELEGANCY, quantitative data on the accep-tance was gathered among the German population. The results confirm the positive perception of hydrogen on a general level. However, the high level of acceptance is decreasing when it comes to infrastructure implementation in the own neighbourhood. In this paper, the gap between acceptance of hydrogen technology on a general level and the level of its infrastructural implementation is analysed, focusing on new pipeline infra-structure. The results show that sociodemographic factors, especially the variable age, as well as project-related factors, especially trust in stakeholders, have a high explanatory power.

Based on quantitative data from a sample of 101 German manufacturing companies, the article analyzes the general awareness about Energy Storage Solutions, possible acceptance factors and perspectives on new business models for the adoption and diffusion of Energy Storage Solutions in an industrial setting. The research presented lead to the development of an acceptance typology and the identification of certain user-types of Energy Storage Solutions in the sample.

In this respect, researchers have recently focused on the technological viability of normative targets (e.g., emissions reduction). Beyond that sufficient condition, experience has shown that missing social acceptance may serve as a severe hurdle to the actual implication. Furthermore, the functional principles of the surrounding political system may prove inconsistent with the scenario's assumptions or implications. As a contribution to scenario methodology, this paper presents an analytic framework with a focus on the German energy transition. Accounting for transparency, social acceptance and political feasibility, future energy scenarios might be inclined to be more mindful of societal limitations. These hurdles may range from subjectively ascribed characteristics of the energy system to political veto-players. While the analytic framework is applied, it is not limited to the four recent energy scenarios published by German public actors. This study's results highlight the need for an advanced scenario construction process, which becomes eminent given that the emphasis is currently moving from if an energy transition is possible to how this goal can be achieved.

Many studies have addressed public acceptance through a case-based empirical lens with rather specific conclusions for individual technologies in a given context. This paper draws more universal insights by conducting an online survey on public acceptance for a set of technologies in the three sub-regions of the Upper Rhine region (URR). Using a representative dataset of 495 German, 501 French, and 493 Swiss inhabitants of the URR, several hypotheses from the acceptance literature are tested across sub-regions and RE technologies and results are compared to related empirical studies from the literature. Moreover, we explore for the first time how public acceptance is linked with community energy and energy autonomy. The latter is especially important to understand how policy and project initiators can mobilise the population to contribute to the energy transition. Our main findings are that public acceptance is, inter alia, highly dependent on the technology in question, the dimension of social acceptance (community versus socio-political dimension) and previous experiences with RE technologies.},

Multi-use (MU) of ocean space, meaning the use of the same space by multiple resource users, has emerged as one strategy to address spatial conflicts resulting from an increasing use density. The proposed multi-use of offshore wind farms (OWF) and mariculture (MAQ) is one of the most-researched examples of such a potentially symbiotic relationship. Two decades of public and academic discourse have produced an abundance of research regarding various facets of this particular combination. Nevertheless, the latest research projects of the EUs Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme have identified a number of persistent barriers to continued multi-use development. The past and current public discourse has created a situation where technological readiness has outpaced societal readiness and the discussion is often complicated by the diversity of backgrounds and perceptions of the participants of this discourse. This study aims to dissect the common discourse on OWF and mariculture multi-use by utilising a targeted SWOT analysis approach based on stakeholder knowledge. This approach reveals two distinct narratives based around societal and economic considerations respectively. From this, we derive a set of tailor-made recommendations for policy makers and regulators as well as funding agencies, businesses and researchers.},

The main theoretical assumption is that the sustainable energy policies designed by National (or supra-National) institutions are translated in practice at the local level through performative connections. The sociology of translation (Callon) is adopted to investigate how ecological modernization is fostered in the energy field at the local level in disadvantaged contexts. This research focuses on the connections which shaped the sustainable transition in the community, considering environmental governance and regulations as well as local social practices.

  abstract             = {This research explores how a new concept, support for energy transition narratives, and other commonly applied social licence factors influence local acceptance of large-scale solar farms. Producing renewable electricity re-quires deploying more large-scale renewable technology infrastructure and support of host communities will be paramount. There is a dearth of studies that investigate a comprehensive set of social licence factors that in-fluence local support of solar farms. Moreover, there is a lack of research considering how broader environmental worldview and beliefs about the energy transition influence local level support for renewable energy infra-structure. Survey data from a large, representative sample of the Australian population is analysed using a network modelling approach to identify conditional associations between variables of interest. Results reveal that general support for renewables in the energy transition had relatively strong direct and indirect associations with local acceptance in addition to social licence factors. Conversely, beliefs about the energy transition beyond the role for renewables (i.e., support for the role of natural gas, support for exporting fossil fuels and willingness to make trade-offs for a faster energy transition) had relatively weak effects on local acceptance and other social licence factors. The findings suggest that individual alignment with broader energy transition narratives explains local solar farm support beyond social licence factors. Future social licence research should consider the role of broader public narratives when investigating the factors that facilitate or impede local acceptance of renewable energy projects.},

Of the various types of ocean energy (wave, tidal, offshore wind, salinity gradient and thermal gradient), this paper is focused on technologies with which to harness the energy from ocean currents. This energy will have considerable possibilities in the future thanks to its high predictability and its enormous potential for the production of electricity. Most of the review papers concerning tidal energy systems are focused on engineering topics. However, there continues to be limited information as regards other aspects, such as those of an economical, social, political, legislative and environmental nature which, together with their interrelationships, need to be dealt with as a whole in order to detect the key drivers that could affect the success or failure of making tidal energy technologies marketable. The objective of this review paper is to address this gap by providing a detailed strategic analysis based on the most up-to-date literature, reports and guidelines. The paper discusses the different disciplines of which the PESTEL analysis (political, economical, social, technological, environmental and legal) is composed and provides different strategies/recommendations through which to mitigate many of the risks identified in order to facilitate the successful development of these technologies and bring them onto the market. Finally, some recent advances in tidal technologies developed by our research group (GIT-ERM) are also highlighted in the technological part of this paper.},

Energy system models help to understand the process and to define either target systems or policy measures. Insights derived from the social sciences are not sufficiently represented in energy system models, but address crucial aspects of the transformation process. It is, therefore, necessary to develop approaches to integrate results from social science studies into energy system models. Hence, as a result of an interdisciplinary discourse among energy system modellers, social scientists, psychologists, economists and political scientists, this article explains which aspects should be considered in the models, how the respective results can be collected and which aspects of integration into energy system models are conceivable to provide an overview for other modellers. As a result of the discourse, five facets are examined: Investment behaviour (market acceptance), user behaviour, local acceptance, technology innovation and socio-political acceptance. Finally, an approach is presented that introduces a compound of energy system models (with a focus on the macro and micro-perspective) as well as submodels on technology genesis and socio-political acceptance, which serves to gain a more fundamental knowledge of the transformation process.},

  abstract  = {The reliance on natural gas for residential sector heating in the United Kingdom (UK) presently accounts for around a fifth of national greenhouse gas emissions. Phasing out this reliance is considered important as the UK's `Net-Zero' ambitions. Alternatives to a reliance on natural gas, include the use of hydrogen boilers and electrification using heat pump technologies. The acceptance of these technologies among different societal actors (including publics) will play a significant role in which are backed, available, and used. The aim of this study was to consider the perceptions of key stakeholders in the UK residential heat decarbonisation sector about: (a) policies pertaining to this sector; (b) the factors likely to shape public acceptance of hydrogen and heat-pump technologies; and (c) the prospect of repurposing the gas pipeline network to support heat decarbonisation. Interviews were held with 12 stakeholders from the UK's residential heating sector. Interviews were supported using bespoke `flash cards' to convey core details about each of the options under consideration. Interview principally considered the relative strengths and drawbacks of hydrogen versus `standard' heat pump options, with discussions centring on four primary themes: Relative risks and benefits; Public choice and control over residential heating options; Engaging with the public throughout the energy transition; and Envisioning future energy transition scenarios for residential home heating. The findings confirm that the factors and actors feeding into the relative `acceptability' of each option are manifold, and that the `acceptance' of each option is tied to factors, such as: (a) the consistency of policy signals from government; (b) the relative affordability of the technology; and (c) both the physical infrastructure and social aspects of the local development context. The concept of repurposing the gas pipeline network was considered to be a good idea in principle, although enthusiasm was heavily caveated with reference to the practicalities of achieving this goal.},

  abstract      = {With substantial decrease in the cost of renewable energy technologies (RETs), governments around the world stepped up efforts to transform the ways energy is produced, and the manners it is consumed. Focusing on attainment of SDG-7 through clean energy transition, the aim has been to achieve energy security as well as energy equity while reducing dependence on energy imports. Although ongoing technological breakthroughs and maturity offers promising opportunities, many developing nations are grappling with intertwined socioeconomic dynamics and policy prioritization. Under the resource-constrained financial situation, Government of Pakistan adopted prosumers' approach to harness year-round available solar energy. Regulatory measures were accordingly instituted, and the electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) were instructed to facilitate people in becoming prosumers. The adoption rates were however well short of the desired outcomes. Besides cultural and socioeconomic dynamics, human interaction with technology, and their level of awareness about related policy parameters play critical role in the technology adoption. In part, this realization led Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Pakistan to conduct a survey on the consumers' willingness for taking up the prosumers' role and, on the parameters contributing to their decision e.g., economic conditions, energy quality and reliability, relevant government policies, and their level of awareness about going solar. Utilizing data from the IPS survey, this study explored the linkage between consumers' inclination to install solar energy systems and their awareness about solar photovoltaics (PV) technology, the cost factor and relevant government policies. The study revealed significant correlation between target populace's awareness level and their willingness to become prosumers, highlighting the need for taking policy measures to enhance public awareness on relevant aspects of roof-top solar (RTS) for their due contribution towards sustainable energy solutions in Pakistan.},

To assess the attitudinal consequences of these arguments, we presented a balanced set of seven pro and seven counter arguments concerning one of six electricity-generating technologies (i.e., coal power stations, gas power stations, onshore wind power stations, offshore wind power stations, open space photo-voltaics, or biomass power plants) to respondents with heterogeneous socio-demographic characteristics. We asked them to rate the strength of each argument and report their perceived familiarity with each argument. Based on the respondents' answers, we examined the tendencies that underlie the process of evaluating arguments using different theoretical approaches. We found that persuasiveness ratings are driven by arguments' compatibility with respondents' initial attitudes, arguments' quality (i.e., strong, moderate, or weak), and respondents' perceived familiarity with the arguments. Furthermore, we determined the extent to which respondents' initial attitudes toward an electricity-generating technology, measured immediately before evaluation of 14 conflicting arguments, changed after exposure to the arguments. Unlike former studies on attitude polarization, we examined conditional probabilities instead of the absolute level of global attitude change or the marginal probabilities of attitude change and persistence. This allowed for more nuanced (re)examination of the issue and showed, among other results, that attitude polarization is the exception rather than the rule.},

This study explores the public perception and acceptance of a new concept: shared car services in multi-unit residential buildings, offering residents tailored solutions while retaining the convenience of private car ownership. The study provides insights about the motivations and barriers to adoption among urban dwellers in Israel, using the methodology of focus groups to collect data and the Product Service System approach for analysis. This concept remains unexplored in current literature. The findings from three focus groups comprising Israeli dwellers in multi-unit buildings in densely populated areas suggest that the acceptance and adoption of such services are influenced by the availability of on- and offstreet parking, cost of private car ownership, service quality, and trust among users and toward the service provider. To remove adoption barriers and promote low-carbon sustainable mobility, policy implications include increasing the cost of car ownership and parking fees while reducing parking availability. Implementing more restrictive parking policies should be coupled with policy incentives that widen the availability of shared vehicle services. The insights gained could inform the integration of shared vehicles in multi-unit buildings and promote the development of supportive regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the study investigates whether the adoption of shared electric vehicle services in residential buildings encourages the installation of rooftop photovoltaic technology. However, the study reveals no significant association between adopting shared electric vehicle services and rooftop solar panel installation among participants.},

  abstract        = {In most countries, energy transitions are well supported by the public; however, the implementation of renewable energy policies at the local level is often beset with resistance. Previous research has mainly focused on factors influencing community acceptance and strategies to improve social acceptance. Meanwhile, there has been limited analysis of the institutional gaps that lead to local resistance and the dynamic effects of institutional factors on renewable energy implementation at the local level. This paper thus investigates Taiwan's regulations for renewable energy development, presenting a detailed case study from a local context. It examines the factors contributing to local resistance to the implementation of national renewable energy policy targets and explores the dynamics of these resistance actions. Furthermore, through the lens of multi-level governance, the study reveals the institutional gaps and interactions that influence the execution of national policy at the local level. Six major institutional gaps in Taiwan's renewable energy governance were identified, including the lack of energy governance authorizations for local governments, a lack of superordinate site selection criteria and evaluation mechanisms for development zones, lack of governance systems that can address multiple issues, lack of scientific and academic information, lack of information disclosure and public participation mechanisms, and the burden of carbon reduction responsibilities and costs on local communities with few or no benefits. Compounded together, these six institutional gaps lead to the buildup of negative experiences interacting with the government and the renewable energy industry and feelings of worry, panic, distrust, and injustice among the local populace. These ultimately trigger resistance attitudes and the adoption of protest actions, hindering solar farm developments from reaching national policy targets. This study highlights the critical role of multi-level governance in facilitating the energy transition, emphasizing that the successful development of renewable energy requires a robust institutional framework. Such a framework is essential for addressing the complex governance challenges that arise during this transition, particularly aspects supporting local engagement. The six institutional gaps identified from the Taiwan case can serve as policy references for countries or cities intending to promote ground-mounted solar power.},

  abstract      = {In response to the urgent threat of climate change and the drivers of high greenhouse gas emissions, countries worldwide are adopting policies to reduce their carbon emissions, with net-zero emissions targets. These targets vary by region, with Canada aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In response to the Independent Electricity System Operator's (IESO's) ``Pathways to Decarbonization'' report, which evaluates a proposed moratorium on new natural gas generating stations, this study presents a methodology to support energy transitions in Ontario by using a modified Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, which focuses on replacing fossil fuel power plants (FFPPs) with clean energy sources, including nuclear, solar, wind, and hydro. This research expands on our prior work that used the DICE model to evaluate the potential for replacing FFPPs with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) on a global scale. This study includes solar, wind, hydro, and SMRs to provide a diversified clean energy portfolio and integrates fuzzy logic to optimize construction rates and address uncertainties. The study uses Ontario as a case study, aligning with IESO's objectives for Ontario's energy transition. The IESO's projections for net zero by 2050 are applied. The study is extended to 2100 to assess the longer-term implications of sustained energy transition efforts beyond the immediate goals set by the IESO. This approach is scalable to other regions and countries with similar energy transition challenges. The study results indicate that to meet Ontario's 2050 net-zero target, approximately 183 SMR units, 1527 solar units, 289 wind units, and 449 hydro units need to be constructed. For the 2100 target, the required number of units is slightly higher due to the longer time frame, reflecting a gradual ramp-up in construction. The optimization of construction rates using fuzzy logic shows that the pace of deployment is influenced by critical factors such as resource availability, policy support, and public acceptance. This underscores the need for accelerated clean energy deployment to meet long-term emissions reduction goals. The findings highlight the complexities of transitioning to a low-carbon energy system and the importance of addressing uncertainties in planning. Policymakers are urged to integrate these insights into strategic energy planning to ensure the successful deployment of clean energy technologies. This study provides valuable recommendations for optimizing energy transitions through a robust, flexible framework that accounts for both technological and socio-economic challenges.},

The generation of renewable energy has seen significant upturn in the last decade. Renewables can be exploited to meet the global energy needs and climate change mitigation goals. Therefore, development of urban and regional energy systems must take into account the possibilities and challenges posed by the increasing penetration of the renewable. The achievement of goals of the energy system in the context of transition to low-carbon energy society rises numerous complex decisions over development of infrastructure and technologies. Although renewable energy devices generate clean energy, they also change landscape. The term of energy-scape encourages discussion about interactions between the energy system and the environment, and other ecosystem services at local level. The paper reviews previous studies analysing energy-scape elements and provides the insights towards the transition to low-carbon energy and low-carbon society in general. The systematic literature review allows clearly outlining the problem and gives reliable background for further studies. The main contribution of the article to the existing literature is the creation of framework for the analysis and assessment of new renewable energy technologies installation and infrastructure. The presented framework can be applied for all renewable energy technologies and infrastructure in both urban and rural areas and allows to attain a decision acceptable to the local community.},

The development of energy technologies and economic instruments has created new interactive forms for prosumers involvement. The paper systematically analyzes new business models for energy prosumption and performs SWOT analysis from the prosumers' perspective. The systematic literature review was applied to outline the main business models for energy prosumption. The performed analysis also allowed the main policy directions for the further development of prosumerism to be identified. The paper presents integrated analysis of Aggregator, Demand Response, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Platforms, Energy as a Service, Collective Services and Pay as You Go models. It was revealed that the main enablers encouraging energy prosumption are environmental concern, energy independence, control over energy (micro)generation, new and user-friendly technologies, energy saving and monetization of surplus energy, and stable and clear regulatory framework. The main barriers include lack of effective support initiatives, quite slow market pene- tration of innovative technologies, and low level of public awareness and acceptance. Finally, the main policy directions to encourage further development of energy prosumption are provided.},

  abstract        = {The need to advance energy transition has arisen from the global challenge of climate change. Shifts to renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. The use of agrivoltaics-the combination of food and renewable energy production with photovoltaic technology-is gaining scientific attention. Agrivoltaics is a type of multifunctional energy landscape and thus reduces land use conflicts between energy and food production. However, while agrivoltaics has begun to proliferate at a global scale, the associated landscape changes have so far received little attention. This knowledge gap is critical, as there is clear evidence that landscape change often contributes to low levels of acceptance of solar power installations. To address this gap, this study examines landscape changes brought by agrivoltaic installations in the Netherlands. Four representative built cases were examined making use of key landscape change indicators extracted from the literature and fieldwork. The study revealed varying degrees of landscape change across the examined cases. Changes in the agricultural landscape pattern and openness emerged as prominent landscape changes. Changes in crop type and in historical linear landscape structures-often associated with the implementation of conventional solar power plants-were not identified. Policy attention to the siting and design of agrivoltaic systems in the landscape is needed to positively influence social acceptance of this relatively novel solution and thereby advance energy transition.},

  abstract      = {The system integration of an increasing amount of electricity generation from decentralised renewable energy sources (RES-E) is a major challenge for the transition of the European power system. The feed-in profiles and the potential of RES-E vary along the geographical and temporal dimension and are also subject to technological choices and changes. To support power system planning in the context of RES-E expansion and allocation planning required for meeting RES-E targets, analyses are needed assessing where and which RES-E capacities are likely to be expanded. This requires models that are able to consider the power grid capacity and topology including their changes over time. We therefore developed a model that meets these requirements and considers the assignment of RES-E potentials to grid nodes as variable. This is a major advancement in comparison to existing approaches based on a fixed and pre-defined assignment of RES-E potentials to a node. While our model is generic and includes data for all of Europe, we demonstrate the model in the context of a case study in the Republic of Ireland. We find wind onshore to be the dominating RES-E technology from a cost-efficient perspective. Since spatial wind onshore potentials are highest in the West and North of the country, this leads to a high capacity concentration in these areas. Should policy makers wish to diversify the RES-E portfolio, we find that a diversification mainly based on bioenergy and wind offshore is achievable at a moderate cost increase. Including solar photovoltaics into the portfolio, particularly rooftop installations, however, leads to a significant cost increase but also to a more scattered capacity installation over the country.

Public participation plays a pivotal role in this transition, yet public attitudes towards decarbonised heating remain under-researched and poorly understood. We report a nationally representative online survey of 2226 individuals in Great Britain. The survey explored attitudes to three decarbonised heating technologies currently being trialled or entering the market: heat pumps, hydrogen heating, and district heating networks. A wide dataset of interrelated variables was collected, including heating system preference and usage, knowledge and support for decarbonised heating, environmental and energy security concerns, perceptions of trust and responsibility, financial considerations, and many others. Central to the study were two methodological innovations; an informed choice decision pathway element designed to investigate key factors underlying personal willingness to adopt each technology, and a psychometric network modelling approach that allowed deep exploration of the structural and dynamic properties of attitudes to decarbonised heating. Findings indicated that the majority of respondents had were aware and supportive towards decarbonised heating, particularly towards heat pumps. However, knowledge of these technologies was limited. Government and energy actors were seen as somewhat untrustworthy but ultimately responsible for funding the transition, and respondents supported policies emphasising government responsibility. When informed, respondent's willingness to adopt decarbonised heating technologies appeared resistant to change, and not strongly influenced any key factors. However, network modelling estimated normative social forces ('social circle' effect) were highly influential in shaping attitudes to decarbonised heating.},

  abstract             = {Public concerns surrounding landscape conservation, noise pollution and impacts on bird populations are commonly incorporated into the planning phase of wind energy projects. However, public involvement tends to be highly localized and procedural, aimed at informing local stakeholders and gaining their acceptance for implementation. At the same time, other ways of engaging the public have emerged that move beyond invited stakeholder participation to facilitate the co-production of wind energy technologies and the landscapes in which they are placed. This paper systematically reviews the academic literature with the aim of identifying and characterizing these modes of co-production. A total of 230 papers published between 2009 and 2019 that report on public engagement with wind energy were included in our review. From this sample, we characterise public engagement into three modes of co-production: (1) local co-production, in spatially proximate wind energy projects; (2) collective co-production, performed through collaboration among different actors in the wind energy sector, joined ownership or consumption of wind energy; and (3) virtual co-production, mediated through information technology. These different modes of co-production cover a broad spectrum of ways in which local and non-local publics engage in decisions about where, when, how and by whom wind energy projects are designed, developed and managed over time. Combined, they can offer guidance for future research on how the wind energy sector can further support a transition to sustainable and inclusive energy systems.},

  abstract  = {In this article we address social acceptance in marine governance. Public support and opposition are critical to any future developments of marine areas, and are often neglected aspects. Whilst one of the main new developments in European marine areas is the increase in sites for offshore wind, social acceptance of renewable energy developments in Europe is shown to be low in a series of on-going studies. There is perhaps often a sense that renewables such as wind, wave and tidal will be `out of sight, out of mind' when developed offshore but the empirical research evidence from across Europe suggests otherwise. People are protesting against offshore wind, and doing so very effectively, preventing and delaying the development of projects. This article articulates the term `social acceptance' as a goal in marine policy implementation in European waters in general, and provides illustrations of the implications of social acceptance of offshore wind in a series of case studies. The experiences of social acceptance, together with theoretical insights, should be taken into account in future innovations for blue energy at sea, including the wind farms, but also wave and tidal devices and other technological developments.

The European Union instructs maritime spatial planning across member states that motivates coordination of activities, stakeholders, policies, governance levels and nations. Social innovation is a concept addressing ways in which changing attitudes, behaviour or perceptions are leading to new and improved ways of acting jointly within a group and beyond. The main aim of this article is to explore social innovation in maritime spatial planning. Instances of social innovation are assessed across three sectors in the Dutch North Sea: the offshore wind energy, the offshore mussel cultivation and the offshore seaweed farming. The assessment shows that, while existing systems of social innovation are favourable to the offshore wind expansions, the barriers to grow for the offshore mussel sector include low willingness to change within the sector, and disadvantageous governmental support to change. The offshore seaweed farming is in a stage of re-organisation of not yet developed regulations, rules and norms for production offshore and enhanced co-operation, with unsure outcomes. Maritime spatial planning can play a more influential role for change if tackling main challenges, including inclusiveness, accountability, private user rights and realisation of organisation or reorganisation, and if making use of the potentials of knowledge brokers when sectors are advancing with new technologies.},

However, a comprehensive analysis should include additional technical aspects, such as blowouts as well as transportation, storage and use of hazardous substances. This research characterizes and quantifies different technological risks associated with deep geothermal energy systems. Risk indicators are calculated for accident risk related to blowouts in the drilling and stimulation phases, and the use of hazardous substances in the drilling, stimulation, and operational phases. A comparison between identified risks is carried out, showing that the stimulation and the operational phases exhibit the highest expected and extreme risks, respectively. Finally, a comparison between different energy technologies showed that the accident risk of deep geothermal energy systems is similar to wind offshore (worst case scenario) or even slightly better than solar photovoltaic (best case), and outperforms fossil, hydropower, hydrogen and biogas energy chains.},

Results of Time 1 (pre-information) indicate affect is positively associated with shallow geothermal systems' evaluations. At Time 2 (post-information, three weeks later), citizens signif-icantly updated their affect and evaluations with the information provision. The effect was double for negative over positive information, and enhanced by citizens' biospheric values. At Time 3 (three months post-information) changes were partially retained only in the negative information condition. In informational campaigns, we thus recommend focusing on reducing the effects of negative messages while tailoring positive messages around citizens' values, to minimize the temporal decay and maximize the positivity of geothermal systems' image in the public's eye.},

  abstract             = {The potential of geothermal energy for energy transition is increasingly recognized by governments around the world. Whether geothermal energy is a sustainable source of heat and/or electricity depends on how it is deployed in specific contexts. Therefore, it is striking that there is only limited attention to geothermal energy from a social science and humanities (SSH) perspective. Geothermal energy is largely conceptualized as a technological and/or geological issue in both science and practice. This perspective article aims to go beyond such conceptualizations by positioning social science research as an important lens to explore the promises and pitfalls of geothermal energy. We first provide an overview of the current state of geothermal energy as a decarbonization strategy. Second, we move on to review the existing literature. This review shows that studies that do address geothermal energy from an SSH perspective tend to be of a descriptive nature and lack analytical diversity. Third, we discuss three complementary theoretical approaches that are used in the social sciences to observe and address other forms of energy and energy transition. We believe that socio-technical assemblages, systems, and imaginaries can provide fruitful analytical lenses to study the promises, pitfalls and spatialization of geothermal energy. We conclude the paper with a research agenda and call for further engagement with this topic in SSH research, with attention to specificities of global South and North contexts.},

We assume a policy feedback perspective and, thus, start from the idea that the current domestic energy context influences what future policies are possible and preferred by citizens. High political trust and strong climate change attitudes are expected to strengthen this relationship. Our results do not lend support to a general link between existing policies and future policy preferences. However, we find evidence of a positive policy feedback in individuals with strong climate change attitudes and/or high levels of political trust, which, depending on each country's current energy policy, either hinders or facilitates the energy transition.},

However, previous research finds that risk perception issues are particularly challenging for emerging and potentially unfamiliar technologies. Hydrogen as a fuel falls into this category. Thus, while the hydrogen value chain could offer a range of potential environmental, economic and social benefits, it is imperative that the roll-out of hydrogen fits with societal expectations of how risk ought to be managed-and by whom. Communication and engagement are critical to ensure 1) communities and stakeholders are able to come to informed decisions on hydrogen and 2) developers, operators and regulators are able to respond to societal concerns and adapt practices appropriately.Within the hydrogen value chain, geological storage may be an important step, but could present challenges in terms of perceived safety. Lessons can be learned from international research and practice of CO2 and natural gas storage in geological formations [for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and power respectively] which may be relevant to hydrogen storage in salt caverns or porous sandstones. We draw on these analogues to present potential societal risk perception issues which may arise for geological storage of hydrogen. We argue that site-specific communication and engagement strategies, underpinned by broad-based principles covering the entire span of the project and a clear rationale for how hydrogen benefits the climate and the most vulnerable members of society under an energy crisis, will be critical to fostering societal support for geological hydrogen storage.},

Its success will depend both on technological progress and on public reaction to this technology. The goal of this study is to analyze how deep geothermal energy has been discussed in the mass media in Switzerland, with an emphasis on the actors, as well as on the arguments and frames they use. We analyze media articles published from 1997 to 2013 in two major Swiss newspapers. In addition to scrutinizing arguments in favor of or against deep geothermal energy, we cluster them around four major frames-energy transition, risks, technology, and costs-with the first and second being the most prevalent We compare which actors promote which frames and show that industry predominantly focuses on the technology's potential for energy transition, while science presents information about risks. We discuss how these frames might impede the future development of deep geothermal energy and conclude by stressing the importance of transparency and public engagement in the siting process of future geothermal projects.

  abstract  = {The capture and storage Of CO2 is gaining attention as an option for limiting CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. CO2 capture is premised on the safe long-term storage Of CO2 in geological formations. Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA, Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2 has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s. The Cost Of CO2 capture from low concentration industrial sources varies with a number of factors, but will certainly be very much higher than the recovery of naturally-occurring CO2. Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas industry for the application Of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2 storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic incentives for the key actors involved. This article discusses the most important research directions for CO2 capture and storage projects that have been initiated around the world. The adequacy of economic incentives will strongly influence how quickly producers and users of fossil fuels are able to close the knowing-doing gap for CO2 capture and storage.},

A wide range of changes in household energy behavior is needed to realize a sustainable energy transition. We propose a general framework to understand and encourage sustainable energy behaviors, comprising four key issues. First, we need to identify which behaviors need to be changed. A sustainable energy transition involves changes in a wide range of energy behaviors, including the adoption of sustainable energy sources and energy-efficient technology, investments in energy efficiency measures in buildings, and changes in direct and indirect energy use behavior. Second, we need to understand which factors underlie these different types of sustainable energy behaviors. We discuss three main factors that influence sustainable energy behaviors: knowledge, motivations, and contextual factors. Third, we need to test the effects of interventions aimed to promote sustainable energy behaviors. Interventions can be aimed at changing the actual costs and benefits of behavior, or at changing people's perceptions and evaluations of different costs and benefits of behavioral options. Fourth, it is important to understand which factors affect the acceptability of energy policies and energy systems changes. We discuss important findings from psychological studies on these four topics, and propose a research agenda to further explore these topics. We emphasize the need of an integrated approach in studying the human dimensions of a sustainable energy transition that increases our understanding of which general factors affect a wide range of energy behaviors as well as the acceptability of different energy policies and energy system changes.},

The game proves to help elicit valid preferences of the participants and lead to measurable learning effects about this complex, multi-dimensional topic. The results show that these 44 participants prefer a diverse mix of renewable technologies for Switzerland in 2035. In terms of siting, these participants consistently choose the efficiency strategy, where new plants are concentrated in the areas where they produce most electricity at least cost, in contrast to the strategy of regional equity, where all Swiss regions would equally build new generation and share the benefits and burdens of the energy transition.},

  abstract        = {While solar and wind energy continue to grow as significant sources of renewable energy, a global energy transition away from fossil fuels will require an expanding portfolio of generating resources. Marine renewable energy has the potential to contribute greatly in the coming decades, as the more predictable nature of wave energy can support the resiliency of the power grid and complement solar and inland wind generation. Yet, the broad deployment of marine energy technologies like wave energy will depend on public support, making it critical to identify the relevant factors associated with public attitudes and risk/benefit perceptions. This paper draws on social representations theory to specifically examine perceptions of wave energy on the west coast of North America, a site chosen because of the high suitability for wave energy generation and the fact that one of only three wave energy test sites in the world is under development off the coast of Oregon. Using an online survey in June 2020, we recruited a sample of 2000 respondents from California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. We found a majority of respondents held positive attitudes to wave energy, but respondents also had low familiarity - with a quarter of respondents lacking sufficient information to form an opinion. We used logistic regression to identify factors correlated with wave energy attitudes, finding that respondents who were more supportive of wind and solar energy, more optimistic about new technology, and reported more familiarity with wave energy were significantly more likely to have a positive impression of wave energy. Respondents with higher levels of place attachment to coastal areas were more split, as they perceived higher benefits of wave energy - but also higher risks. Our results indicate broad appeal of wave energy on the west coast, but we caution policymakers and developers to not take initial siting processes for granted. As experience has shown for offshore wind, broad appeal does not guarantee a smooth siting process in a local context. The role of place attachment to coastal areas must be taken seriously or risk alienating local communities.},

Against stultifying narratives highlighting the lack of community acceptance for local interventions, we uncover: a) the widespread acceptance of sustainable and smart energy solutions, and b) the willingness of a large proportion of locals to play their part, as engaged energy prosumers, in a green energy transition. In turn, these findings form the basis for future academic and technical interventions on the island, and inform broader conclusions on public engagement around energy. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, past research at an international level suggests that local opposition might undermine otherwise promising transition plans. In order to minimise the problems of technological transfers, it is, thus, imperative to embark on an early-stage exploration of public attitudes towards such innovations. In light, however, of the routine exclusion of social issues in island energy studies, we present timely data from the first-ever questionnaire survey conducted across the islands of the Aegean Sea. In doing so, we uncover the widespread acceptability of green energy solutions developed as part of the internationally acclaimed TILOS (''Technology Innovation for the Local Scale, Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage'') Horizon 2020 project. Simultaneously, though, we draw on the outputs of our unique end-user segmentation analyses and argue that only certain islanders are likely to accept the full replication of the TILOS energy model in their communities. Numerous personal/demographic factors influence the likelihood of accepting specific sustainable energy technologies and, subsequently, only a group of individuals who are young, male, knowledgeable and concerned about the environment are expected to support the proposed technological transition. In turn, we argue that these findings should inform future interventions and research with the ultimate aim of supporting efforts to ``green'' the Aegean archipelago and other non-interconnected islands at an international level.},

  abstract             = {Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to reduce the risks of climate change requires a major transition in society's energy infrastructure; yet despite a growing sense of urgency, deployment of alternative emerging energy technologies has been slow and uncertain. This paper proposes a systematic, interdisciplinary framework for the integrated analysis of regulatory, legal, political, economic, and social factors that influence energy technology deployment decisions at the state level to enhance awareness of the interconnections and enable improved energy policy and planning and accelerated change in society's energy infrastructure. This framework, Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment, (SPEED), integrates analysis of laws, regulations, institutions and policy actors as well as varying regional perceptions and levels of awareness about the risks and benefits of emerging energy technologies to facilitate improved understanding of the complex interconnected components of state energy systems. While this framework has been developed with U.S. states as a model, the SPEED framework is generalizable to other countries with different sub-national structures. We present three research methods that could be applied within the SPEED framework that could be particularly helpful in understanding the integrated socio-political influences on energy technology deployment: (1) policy review and analysis, (2) media analysis, and (3) focus groups and structured interviews with key stakeholders. By integrating the fields of technology diffusion, environmental policy, comparative analysis' of states, and risk perception, future empirical research conducted within this SPEED framework will improve understanding of the interconnected socio-political influences on energy technology deployment to enable energy modelers, policy-makers, energy professionals, state planners and other stakeholders to develop and implement more effective strategies to accelerate the deployment of emerging energy technologies.

We present the results of a comparative qualitative inventory of innovative practices from 25 projects in 12 countries in three supra-national European regions. We assessed participation quality according to three analytical dimensions: rationale, inclusiveness, and participation level. An instrumental rationale, broad inclusiveness, and a participation level of consulting or informing was a combination that was commonly perceived as an innovative participatory practice in most regional contexts. We found a tendency towards more advanced practices in Western Europe, compared to Southern, and Eastern Europe. However, practices that were considered to be innovative in the latter regions still provide important lessons within their geographical contexts.},

Climate change mitigation is causing governments, policymakers, and international organizations worldwide to embark on policies, leading to increased use of renewable energy sources and improvement of energy efficiency. Climate change mitigation actions, including the Green Deal strategy in the EU, require satisfying the expanding energy demand and complying with the environmental restrictions. At the same time, the prevailing market structure and infrastructure relevant to the energy systems are undergoing a crucial transformation. Specifically, there has been a shift from centralized to more decentralized and interactive energy systems that are accompanied by a low-carbon energy transition. Smart Grid technology and other innovations in the area of renewable energy microgeneration technologies have enabled changes in terms of the roles of energy users: they can act as prosumers that are producing and consuming energy at the same time. Renewable energy generation that is allowing for deeper involvement of the citizens may render higher social acceptance, which, in turn, fuels the low-carbon energy transition. The collective energy prosumption in the form of energy cooperatives has become a widespread form of renewable energy initiatives in rural communities. Even though renewable energy consumption provides a lot of benefits and opportunities for rural communities, the fast penetration of renewables and energy prosumption encounter several important barriers in the rural areas. This paper analyses the main barriers and drivers of renewable energy initiatives in rural areas and provides policy implications for the low-carbon energy transition in rural areas.},

Yet, although some studies have underscored the need for resilient industries, only recently researchers have called for an area-wide perspective, where a paradigm shift in Natech risk management fosters a holistic systems approach. That approach should contemplate the facilities and their surrounding environment, and encourage multi-stakeholder interaction to advocate for more resilient societies. However, there are currently no methodologies for evaluating, rating, and certifying industrial facilities' level of preparedness to Natech risk; nor are there any tools available to inform the governments and the public, on industry's Natech risk management practices. In response to this need, we propose Natech RateME, a comprehensive, area-wide risk management, and rating system framework. The proposed framework is premised on a probabilistic risk assessment methodology, that can support industrial facilities' management of onsite and offsite risk from complex events and that rates their performance in terms of minimum life losses. By evaluating their safety performance, their engagement to develop cooperation mechanisms with local authorities and neighboring communities, and their commitment to disclose risk information, among other aspects, the framework, and the rating system, seek to contribute to overall territorial resilience. To do so, Natech RateME considers the interaction between infrastructure systems present at industrial parks, the technical and organizational systems, governance, risk communication, and community participation, constituting the first approach to support the strengthening of prevention and mitigation measures by enhancing facilities' and governments' abilities to manage Natech risk comprehensively.},

Results revealed that almost unanimously people associate solar power with highly positive imagery and that visual characteristics are especially prevalent. The successful realization of renewable energy projects requires policymakers to draw on reliable data about public acceptance of renewables. In response to this need, the present study examined whether assessing public acceptance of renewables on a more concrete level (i.e., by addressing drawbacks) can result in a different, more reliable acceptance rating than assessment on an abstract level, as done at present in opinion polls. Results showed that people do not think about drawbacks related to renewables when they consider it from a general, more abstract, perspective. However, when downsides are specifically addressed, people integrate these into their evaluation, thus diminishing acceptance. Even the highly positive imagery of solar power is relativized and acceptance decreases. These findings have several important implications for policymakers.},

Age-based patterns of exclusion-ageism-has recently been conceptualized in the context of decarbonization as energy ageism. This paper offers a comparative empirical analysis of the senior citizens' outlook towards an imminent energy transition as well as the impact of energy poverty in two European countries: Norway and Poland.Results Drawing on interviews and focus groups with Polish and Norwegian seniors, we present the differences and similarities between the two countries, and the determinants of energy ageism, as well as the concept's overall applicability and empirical usefulness. We find that socioeconomic conditions outweigh ageism, that is, the resilience of senior citizens in dealing with energy poverty during a transition is conditioned by their material standing and welfare state robustness rather than age based. An important factor is household heating technology, combined with economic vulnerability can push some individuals into energy poverty, while others using alternative sources of heat can navigate through energy crises unscathed.Conclusions We note the importance of mainstreaming social inclusion considerations in energy policy and of targeted digital competence building which can enhance senior citizen integration in the energy transition. Lower levels of digital competences among senior citizens certainly play a role and need to be addressed with education programs to increase participation. In both countries, household heating is a major issue and heating sources are strong predictors of energy poverty and regulatory measures and subsidies should be designed at national, regional, and municipal level to assist vulnerable groups in this area.},

Beyond the technical and economic considerations, social acceptance will be immensely important if microgrids are to be widely adopted by the people who live in these communities. This requires complex community engagement strategies delivered by knowledgeable practitioners, encouraging collaborative participation and active community involvement in decision-making. This study investigated how community engagement was applied by nineteen organisations that received funding to undertake microgrid feasibility studies for ninety communities across Australia between 2020 and 2024. A Community-based Participatory research (CBPR) framework was employed to uncover the challenges encountered at each step of the engagement process and what was done to overcome them. The study revealed major community engagement challenges, including inadequate funding, low energy literacy levels, and engagement fatigue. The findings also suggest that due to the inherent complexity of microgrids, these projects need to take an iterative and flexible approach, planning for expansive and resource-intensive engagement with the community to be effective. The research findings provide valuable insights for community engagement practitioners, policymakers, and service providers involved in planning microgrids and developing related policies and programs for rural and remote communities.},

However, the visual impacts of wind farms are still one of the most controversial effects of wind energy development. Photomontage visualisations are frequently used in Visual impact Assessments(2) (VIA) to give a sense of scale of the proposed development. Yet visualisations in VIAs are often perceived to underestimate the scale and magnitude of the visual impact of wind turbines. The aim of this multiphase mixed methods study is to explore the perceived accuracy of images that represent the visual impacts of both onshore and offshore wind farms. Field visits and data from a public survey are used to assess the accuracy of visualisations and to examine the effect of camera lens focal length on perception of scale of wind turbines. Results show that panoramic photomontages are perceived as the least accurate, while images taken at 75 mm focal length in full frame format are perceived as the most accurate form of representation of the scale and visual impact of wind turbines. These findings imply that the panoramic visualisation technique, which has been used for decades to predict the scale of wind turbines in VIAs, is ineffective in predicting accurately the visual impact of wind farms, and an alternative predictive technique is needed. For wind farm visualisations the use of 75 mm full frame image format is recommended in order to improve the accuracy, enable better informed decision making and avoid the loss of credibility of visualisations and VIAs.},

They argue that it ignores the multiple roles people fulfil in everyday life and the multiple levels on which behavioural agency occurs. Accounting for such dynamics is imperative, so these scholars argue, to include a broader variety of social groups in sustainability transitions. This article accounts for the multiple levels on which mnemonic agency occurs. It does so by exploring how the multiple roles that authors of women's guides identified with in the Dutch energy transition to gas and electricity influenced the historical narratives on technological development they constructed. More particularly, the article explores how in their roles as authors, women's organization members and political current supporters women's guide authors `mnemonically imagined' coherent narratives that constituted group identities. The article shows that authors of women's guides embedded their historical narratives within the imagined future and memory scales that the women's organization and political current they identified with prescribed. Identification with a political current guided the perception of the future history progressed towards. Identification with a women's organization drew the authors towards historical precedents on particular societal scales. Within the cadres of their political current and women's organization identities, the women's guide authors mobilized particular memories to construct narratives that adhered to their particular interest. The article concludes that in the studied transition, author agency, women's organization agency and political current agency simultaneously influenced the construction of historical narratives in a layered fashion.},

  abstract  = {Geological survey agencies are developing methods for government geological mapping in the post-paper map era. Surficial and bedrock maps are being digitized and reconciled, while multiple generations of legends are being made accessible in a categorized format. Regional three-dimensional (3-D) geological models that integrate soils and geology, surficial and bedrock geology, as well as onshore and offshore, are increasingly in demand as the information, technology, and protocols to build them progress. Applications such as regional groundwater modeling require digitizing, reconciliation and assembly of a digital elevation model, bathymetry, offshore geology, soils, surficial geology, public domain drillhole and geophysical data, bedrock maps and existing stratigraphic models typically expressed as structure contours. New stratigraphic modeling, particularly required for surficial unconsolidated deposits in many regions, requires information from cored holes logged by geologists, as well as geophysical surveys. These high-quality results are extrapolated laterally using drillhole data, commonly large quantities of water-well data of varying resolution and reliability. Much effort is required to adequately georeference the drillhole data, and to parse large numbers of unique lithological descriptions. Stratigraphic modeling methods ideally use all data and an approach that permits judgement in the acceptance or rejection of data, while interpolation and extrapolation are guided by genetic insights. Models are best captured as a grid of predicted stratigraphy profiles that convey expert opinion on interpolation and extrapolation from the data points. Reconciliation of mapping with that of neighbouring jurisdictions is a key step, as is balancing subjective definition of strata with more objective geostatistical approaches to characterizing the heterogeneous physical properties of the strata. Progress is readily achievable in undeformed strata, while deformed strata present far greater challenges. Increasingly, databases of observations and measurements are being retained alongside the interpreted model, and models are being assigned varying confidence levels, such that the result is seen not as an end but as a means for prioritizing new mapping. Current activity is broadening our reliance not only from paper maps to digital models, but also from plan view maps to drillhole databases, to 3-D models, to dynamic models such as groundwater flow models. Pressing user requirements demand that geological survey work advances rapidly along this progression.},

  abstract        = {Smart home energy management systems (HEMS) are crucial for increasing household energy efficiency, enabling flexibility in energy demand, and integrating renewable energy for sector coupling. While these measures can contribute to decarbonization, they also raise questions about unequal accessibility for different social strata. People with limited financial means and lower digital competencies may have greater difficulty participating in such measures, while others can more easily reap the benefits. This digital divide can potentially exacerbate social and economic inequalities among vulnerable groups. Drawing on empirical survey data (n: 1020) collected in Vienna, Austria, in 2023, this contribution analyzes HEMS adoption through the lens of the digital divide debate. By aggregating multiple digitalization indicators of residential smart energy use, it shows how HEMS adoption is influenced by socio-demographic characteristics, digital competency, social status, modernity, and housing situation. The results show that those of higher social status, who live in single-family homes and have greater concerns about climate change, use significantly more HEMS technologies. Also, men and younger residents adopt more HEMS technologies while income and education level are not significant. A moderation analysis shows that HEMS adoption is moderated by the housing type, with home ownership as an enabling factor for adoption. The study extends the literature and shows that a third level of the digital divide exists in the context of the energy transition, which is characterized by social status and access to social and cultural capital within social networks.},

These value systems and how they shape the perception of who and where alternative energy belongs will shape who does or does not have the opportunity to participate in these alternative visions of energy. Drawing on engineering studies and dialectology research this study examines how a group of engineering students engaged in learning about renewable energy systems perceive the kinds of people in the United States who would or would not adopt alternative energy. Rather than see adoption/non-adoption as a purely ``technical'' matter, students brought their own perceptions of regional, social, and political differences to characterize the potential acceptability of each technology. Certain regions of the United States, despite their technical potential based on government and industry sources, are cast as too culturally backward and resistant to change to embrace new energy sources. These insights elucidate the importance of `engineers' value systems as they continue to play a significant role in shaping the development of alternative energy technologies and markets.},

  abstract             = {The sustainable energy transition to a low-carbon and climate-neutral economy by 2050 requires a consistent increase in the share of renewable energy sources (RESs) at the expense of the share of fossil fuels. The coal power plants in the Republic of Bulgaria have provided about one third of the annually produced electric power for decades, utilizing mainly locally available sources of lignite. The present work aimed to review the progress of the energy transition, its rejection and acceptance at the national and international scene alongside the available research for cleaner coal combustion in Bulgaria, as well as discuss a Bulgarian perspective for coal share reduction options for power generation during the energy transition. A comprehensive review was carried out, based on freely accessible data such as research and open media articles, officially published field reports, legislative and strategic acts as well as validated statistical data. Three groups of critical gaps (socioeconomic, sociotechnical and cultural and political) were indicated, claimed to be capable of guiding the just transition. Key factors influencing the process dynamics were identified and categorized in the context of the critical gaps. The peculiar policy criteria for the carbon-intensive regions are as follows: the dominant energy carriers, existing infrastructure, involved actors and choice of strategy. The observations allowed us to conclude that in addition to the efforts achieved and ambitious political will, the identification of reliable technological and socioeconomic measures is needed more than ever (accompanied by interdisciplinary research involving the technical, social and environmental and policy factors), while renewables still have long way to go towards complete substitution of the fossil fuels for power generation, transport, and manufacturing. Limited literature was found for reducing the share of coal from currently operating Bulgarian coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). Herein, short- and/or medium-term measures for carbon emission reduction were discussed, capable of promoting the limited operation of existing CFPPs, thus paving the road towards a sustainable, long-term transition. These measures concerned the typically used power units in the largest CFPPs located at the Maritsa Iztok Mining Complex (MIMC). Analyses of the biomass production, supply and cost for the same type of power units were proposed, considering the use of 100% biomass. Estimated costs, unit efficiencies and power generation were discussed along with the evaluations about the land use, ensuring a given annual productivity of wood chips from fast growing plants, e.g., Paulownia.},

Public procurement conditional on climate-friendly operation is catalyzing a transition to battery-electric operation, where most ferries will be battery-electric or fueled by hydrogen by 2030. The comparison to ferries is performed with the help of a methodology inspired by the multi-attribute utility method, which contains 11 features related to technology, operation, and acceptance. This score is used to adjust the 70% CO2 emission reduction achieved by ferries. Based on this methodology, the CO2 emission reduction potential for express boats, offshore support vessels, and aquaculture support vessels is estimated to be 46%. Consequently, these short-sea shipping segments could reduce CO2 emissions by 0.8 million tonnes from 2017 to 2030, which is equivalent to 1.5% of Norwegian emissions in 2017. Norway's experience indicates that there is a sizable potential for reducing CO2 emissions for public procurement conditional on climate-friendly solutions for short-sea shipping in other shipping nations.},

  abstract        = {Large-scale solar energy developments bring significant environmental and community benefits, but they can also impose negative impacts, particularly on host communities. Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) have emerged as a strategy to mitigate these adverse effects. This study examines community preferences regarding CBAs associated with large-scale solar farms. Our investigation focuses on two critical CBAs aspects: the choice between mandated or voluntary implementation and the preference for private or collective benefit distribution. Additionally, we explore how individual values shape community members' attitudes towards solar technology. Our findings reveal a clear preference within the surveyed community for privately distributing benefits over establishing a collective trust fund, and for voluntary implementation rather than government mandates. However, it is essential to recognize that the community is not monolithic and can be placed into three classes: a minority of solar-reluctant individuals (7.5 %), a significant solar-receptive group (24.2 %), and a substantial disengaged majority (68.3 %). Among these groups, the solar-receptive segment displays the most interest in private benefits; yet, they favor government-mandated agreements. Moreover, values play a significant role in shaping preferences within each group, with biospherism correlating with greater support for mandated, private benefits among respondents in the reluctant and receptive groups. Conversely, hedonistic values predict a greater inclination among the reluctant group to live further away from solar developments. Based on these findings, policies should prioritize voluntary, private benefit distribution while remaining adaptable to align with community preferences. Engaging community members in the decision-making can help tailor solutions that resonate with their values and preferences.},

We examined articles on geothermal energy written over ten years. Applying a quantitative framing analysis, we investigated the salience of six frames indicated in the literature as often used in communications on geothermal energy: energy security, economy, legislation, environment, knowledge, and social issues. We also examined the tone and source of the frames. The analysis reveals an overall positive tone in the newspaper articles, especially regarding the technology's energy security and economic potential, with the primary source being the national government. Possible adverse effects of geothermal technology are covered less often, particularly those related to social issues at the local level. We describe the different frames identified, provide examples and discuss implications.},

Achieving full decarbonisation requires not only the diffusion of net-zero emission technologies but also the phase-out of technologies that emit greenhouse gases (GHG). However, implementing policy changes in these sectors can have an immediate and significant impact on people's day-to-day life, leading to a higher risk of political backlash, as exemplified by the yellow vest movement in France. In this study, we investigate public preferences for phase-out policy packages in both sectors in Germany by conducting two conjoint experiments with 1,777 respondents in March 2022. Respondents collectively evaluated a total of 17,770 policy packages per sector, specifically targeting the phase-out of fossil fuel-based heating systems and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). We find that respondents favour earlier phase-out dates for both technologies, but the type of preferred instruments varies: while regulatory instruments like bans are preferred for heating systems, economic instruments like taxes are preferred for ICEVs. These preferences are even more pronounced in people most concerned about climate change. In addition, we find that people with higher knowledge about sector emissions tend to demonstrate higher acceptance of policy interventions and that supportive measures significantly enhance the attractiveness of policy packages. Our findings can inform the design of phase-out policy packages, potentially increasing their acceptability and political feasibility.},

Using data from 532 respondents, the authors analyzed overall public preferences and how demographics affect technology preferences. Contrary to what is often assumed, the authors found that approximately 75 % of respondents' ideal portfolios are diverse (5+ technologies), and many included novel technologies, with approximately 90 % including CCS or offshore wind. Regression analysis found that demographic factors affect the amount of a technology that a respondent chose to deploy in their portfolio. Demonstrating the public's willingness to accept a diverse electricity portfolio that includes novel technologies opens the door for energy analysts and energy developers to investigate diverse and creative solutions to achieve electricity decarbonization. Additionally, demographic factors that affect technology preferences create a new layer of consideration for project siting to increase the likelihood of acceptance. Engaging with the public and considering public preferences will be integral to achieving the U.S.'s decarbonization goals.},

  abstract             = {Carbon capture and storage has been considered as a realistic approach to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, the cost of capturing high-purity CO2 typically used for geological storage (e.g., 98%) is high. Direct air capture (DAC), a technology that extracts CO2 of relatively low-purity from the ambient atmosphere, has been recently proposed as a means to achieve negative CO2 emissions when the product is sequestered underground. Although the CO2 produced by DAC is of low-purity, the other gaseous components (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) are not hazardous materials like NOx and SOx that must be typically dealt with by conventional projects in coal-burning plants. Here, we evaluate geological storage of the low-purity CO2 captured via advanced membrane-based DAC technology. The ubiquity of ambient air is important in reducing transport costs and ensuring social acceptance as the CO2 product can be both produced and stored at sites in remote areas, such as deserts and offshore platforms. We calculated the density of CO2-N-2-O-2 mixtures via molecular dynamics simulation and evaluated the cost of the low-purity CO2 storage. Our evaluation suggests that the storage of low-purity CO2 in geological formations is environmentally acceptable and economically viable. (c) 2021 The Authors.

To be impactful, many hundreds of these small capacity reactors would have to be deployed rapidly. Consequently, hundreds of communities in a wide variety of settings would need to host reactors. This is a formidable challenge. Multiple criticisms have been leveled against proponents' claims that this challenge will be met, including economic factors. A review of the literature about small modular reactors and micro-reactors found that both advocates and critics largely ignore the challenge of community acceptance. Drawing upon the literature into the siting of other kinds of controversial facilities, this review identified obstacles and opportunities for decision processes that seek community acceptance. It explores the relevance of those insights to the siting of small capacity reactors. While some communities are likely to embrace the opportunity to host reactors, experiences across a range of facility siting efforts reinforces the conclusion that site-specific community opposition is likely to be another major obstacle to large-scale deployment of small capacity nuclear reactors thereby jeopardizing their potential contribution to decarbonization.},

  abstract             = {Most climate change mitigation scenarios rely on negative emissions technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). However, little is known about public support for BECCS. This paper gauges Danes' willingness to pay (WTP) for biomass with carbon capture and storage and examines factors influencing it. Denmark is a suitable case study given its reliance on biomass and negative emissions to achieve climate targets. Results from a questionnaire-based survey indicate a mean WTP of 3072 DKK (412 EUR) per household per year. This correspondents to a 12% increase in heat and electricity expenses. The need for negative emissions is the main stated reason for WTP. This may be interpreted as reflecting either support for, or reluctant acceptance of, BECCS. Results show that being younger, being concerned about climate change and believing that it is mainly caused by human activity, and believing in the mitigation potential of biomass and that sustainability is a precondition of its use have a significant effect on WTP. Public views on BECCS are complex but must be acknowledged if discussion of the role of BECCS in the decarbonisation agenda is to move forward.},

Our analysis draws on a survey experiment in Switzerland, where the number of wind turbines will grow from a couple of dozens to many hundreds in the next three decades. We find that exposure to wind turbines increases public acceptance, but this affect does not translate into electoral turnout or vote choice. Moreover, locality or politicisation does not seem to have an effect at all-neither on acceptance nor on electoral outcomes. Our results suggest that voters do not reward or punish political parties for their positions on wind energy, even when turbines might soon be rising in their local area.},

Several years' responses from the General Social Survey, a large, nationally representative poll of United States adults, confirm that, in this context, the association between greater religiosity and lesser support for pro-environmental policy extends to questions of energy transition: more fervently religious respondents, and those who more fully endorse fundamentalist interpretations of the Christian Bible, are less likely to support government funding of developing alternative energy sources. This result holds even when accounting for respondents' broader attitudes towards environmental and science policy. The connection between religiosity on attitudes towards energy policy is more robust in some Christian traditions than others: among Catholics, though not Protestants, it appears even when controlling for broader ideological positions.},

Several analyses have shown that nuclear technologies may represent very attractive options for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, especially in countries with high growth projections for energy demand. Our objective is to analyze the role of nuclear energy in long-term climate scenarios using the World-TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) bottom-up model. World-TIMES is a global model that optimizes the energy system of 15 regions over a 100-year horizon (2000-2100). We present energy and emission results for climate scenarios for two levels of CO2 concentration (450 and 550 ppmv by 2100). We analyze the penetration level of nuclear energy under various sets of assumptions on technology parameters and exogenous constraints on nuclear development to reflect social perceptions. Nuclear energy technologies satisfy a large portion of electricity production in many regions. Most regions experience an energy transition based on advanced oil and gas technologies and hydropower. Other renewable technologies might play a more important role but need further cost reductions or new regulations to penetrate the market in substantial proportions. Carbon sequestration and endogenous demand reductions for energy services are also significantly contributing to reach environmental target. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The review analyzes a corpus of 78 articles indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS, published between 1997 and 2022. The review identified three research areas related to green hydrogen and the challenges for the social sciences in the future: (a) risks, socio-environmental impacts, and public perception; (b) public policies and regulation and (c) social acceptance and willingness to use associated technologies. Our results show that Europe and Asia lead the research on green hydrogen from the social sciences. Also, most of the works focus on the area of public policy and regulation and social acceptance. Instead, the field of social perception of risk is much less developed. We found that little research from the social sciences has focused on assessments of the social and environmental impacts of hydrogen on local communities and indigenous groups, as well as the participation of local authorities in rural locations. Likewise, there are few integrated studies (technical and social) that would allow a better assessment of hydrogen and cleaner energy transitions. Finally, the lack of familiarity with this technology in many cases constitutes a limitation when evaluating its acceptance.},

This development also raises new potential issues such as increased electricity demand, a lack of social acceptance, and infrastructural challenges in the built environment. Relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers and service providers, need to align their values and prioritize these aspects. Our study investigates the prioritization of 11 Dutch decision-makers in the field of public electric vehicle charging. These decision-makers prioritized different indicators related to measurements (e.g., EV adoption rates or charge point profitability), organization (such as fast- or smart-charging), and developments (e.g., the development of mobility-service markets) using the bestworst method. The indicators within these categories were prioritized for three different scenario's in time. The results reveal that priorities will shift from EV adoption and roll-out of infrastructure to managing peak demand, using more sustainable charging techniques (such as V2G), and using sustainable energy towards 2030. Technological advancements and autonomous charging techniques will become more relevant in a later time period, around 2040. Environmental indicators (e.g., local emissions) were consistently valued low, whereas mobility indicators were valued differently across participants, indicating a lack of consensus. Smart charging was consistently valued higher than other charging techniques, independent of time period. The results also revealed that there are some distinct differences between the priorities of policymakers and service providers. Having a systematic overview of what aspects matter supports the policy discussion around EVs in the built environment.},

Many local communities are eager to promote sustainable energy production, to use local financial resources for the local community and to employ democratic governance of energy production and supply. Furthermore, we study how these co-operations are linked to local, regional and national networks for community energy. We use both Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Social Movement Theory (SMT) to investigate the initiatives, as this allows a dynamic analysis of collective strategies. We discuss the obduracy of the energy system and how this system is challenged by new connections between communities and global networks and by new types of energy providers that are rooted in social networks. Furthermore, we draw attention to the way community energy networks provide a social innovation while realizing a decentralized and decarbonized energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that wind power policies are primarily influenced by energy authorities, developers and interest organizations, furthering arguments of climate concerns, energy security and economic opportunity. The emerging voices of local governments, environmental organizations and concerned citizens claim new political engagement related to valuations of (local) environmental, distributional and procedural justice and the recognition of alternative future energy imaginaries. The increase in conflicts and public debates has challenged national politicians to play a more active role in wind power policy making, which entails the reconsideration of wind power as an energy policy and critically judging what, for whom and how wind power should contribute to local, national and global energy transitions.},

Due to a lack of scientific research on civil society preferences for energy production in Chile, we used a convenience sample and conducted a survey among future decision makers (current university students) to identify which factors impact their acceptance or rejection of energy sources. In addition, we asked them about their vision for the future energy mix. In total, 164 valid questionnaires were collected. Results show that the level of acceptance and preference changes with political ideology, with social liberals being more willing to change their lifestyle and increase their willingness to pay for a faster inclusion of clean technologies in the energy mix. Higher levels of education increase this willingness to pay. The level of acceptance decreases up to 56% for solar and wind when the installation is located within a radius less than 5 km from the population's homes. The level of rejection is 97% for hydroelectricity and 99% for non-renewable power plants if they are located at distances lower than 5 km. The decentralization of energy policy decisions and the consideration of local society would be relevant for an energy transition towards renewable sources.},

  abstract             = {The research on people-place relations makes an important contribution to the understanding of the public responses to renewable energy technologies (RETs). Social media not only provides easy access to the sentiments and attitudes of online users towards RETs, but social media content can also shape the discourse, both on- and offline, about RETs. Hence, social media content analysis provides valuable insights into the public responses to RETs. However, as of now, only a small number of studies have investigated people-place relations in the context of the energy transition via online content. To address this lack of knowledge, this study aims to increase the understanding of people-place relations by investigating the relationship between the place scales mentioined in Instagram posts (categorized from local to planet) and the sentiments that are expressed in said posts, depending on different energy infrastructures (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, powerlines, and renewable energy in general). Our analysis of 1500 Instagram posts shows that the place scales that are mentioned in the Instagram posts are related to some differences in the post emotionality, and that these effects differ across the different hashtags that are related to RETs. By using a sociocognitive approach, this study is the first to investigate Instagram posts in the context of the energy transition and people-place relationships.},

This paper seeks to understand how participatory design methods and the integration of renewable energy techniques like photovoltaics can contribute to more democratic, sustainable, and livable urban planning in the age of energy transition. Data was analysed through participatory design workshops in a suburban district in the north of Sweden, with residents living and working there, and with stakeholders from the municipality and the local energy company. The results of the resident design workshop indicate a significant reservoir of knowledge and creative ability among the participants. It emphasizes the importance of bringing people together to share their opinions and ideas for a more democratic planning in the built environment. The stakeholder workshop indicates that co-operations between multiple stakeholders and the development of participatory methods are essential for addressing the problematic issues associated with e.g., building regulations and community shared electricity. Fostering collaboration, and promoting inclusive decision-making, can lead to more effective and sustainable practices, better regulatory frameworks, and improved outcomes for communities.},

A crucial step for such deployments is the assessment of their social, economic and environmental impacts. By reviewing three hundred and sixty-nine studies, this work identifies and synthesises a myriad of social, economic and environmental aspects of RE technologies deployment that have been studied over the past decade. The review identifies barriers and drivers that have been found to be common across countries, and those where studies and/or local contexts have found contradictory results. Amongst social issues, trust and quality of institutional governance were found to be increasingly prominent themes of research and key drivers for RE deployment. The review also reveals a growing interest in attachment to place, but with contradicting findings for its negative or positive impacts. Amongst economic issues, the review found widespread agreement that, irrespective of the type of economy, countries continue to preferentially pursue economic growth through expanded production and innovation in fossil fuels. The review of the environmental impacts found that studies of RE deployments tend to focus on negative local impacts, leaving positive global benefits, such as mitigating climate change, as implicit, and that there are only a few studies on the environmental impacts of RE in developing economies. Two gaps that the review identifies as demanding future work are investigating the benefits of RE co-location in developing economies and redressing the underrepresentation of First Nations perspectives and participation in research and RE deployments.},

Decision science literature argues that conventional opinion surveys are limited for making strategic decisions because the elicited opinions may be distorted by misconceptions and awareness gaps that prevail in the public. We created an informed citizen panel (N = 46) in Switzerland using technology factsheets, interactive web tool Riskmeter, and group discussions. We measured the evolution of the panel's knowledge and preferences from initial (uninformed) to informed and longer-term views 4 weeks after. In terms of energy transition, our elicited technology and portfolio preferences show strong support for the low-carbon electricity sector transition, especially relying on hydropower, solar power, electricity savings and efficiency, and other renewable sources. Since these informed preferences are structurally different from the futures considered by many energy experts, we argue that these preferences should also inform the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050s implementation. In terms of methodologies in decision science, our factsheets, Riskmeter, and group discussions all proved effective in forming the preferences and improving knowledge. But we also intriguingly found that in a longer run the participants tended to revert back to their initial opinions. The latter finding opens up multiple new research questions on the longer-term effectiveness of informational tools and stability of informed preferences.},

DESs such as micro-cogeneration and multi-energy hubs integrate renewable energy sources, small-scale combined heat/power production, various energy storage methods, and active demand-side management. Research on adopting these systems within existing neighborhood contexts remains scarce, however, particularly on the role of local actors such as local energy utilities, ownership, and the spatial scale of implementation for accelerating the adoption of DESs. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the relevant scientific literature on the adoption and social acceptance of DESs, followed by a series of semistructured interviews with representatives of DES pilot implementations. Our findings indicate that local coownership and awareness of local benefits tend to improve the acceptance of distributed energy infrastructures. The study found that established energy actors such as energy utilities and grid operators currently test DESs on a local scale in terms of the systems' technical and financial feasibilities. The study also identified major regulatory and structural barriers to DES market adoption that must be overcome to accelerate the current rate of niche development; the study thus contributes to developing DES adoption strategies. We provide future research trajectories that would address the role of spatial proximity and deployment models to attain a more dynamic understanding of the social acceptance of new energy technologies.},

  abstract        = {Participation and public involvement often occur late in energy planning or only in the approval phase, limiting substantial discussions or exchange of perspectives. As a result, current participatory planning emphasizes acceptance rather than efforts to seek shared solutions for energy transition, which leads to considerable resistance to local energy transition projects. To identify shared solutions in local energy transition, understanding residents' perspectives on regional energy transition and how they relate to residents' perspectives on regional spatial developments is crucial. Therefore, this research explores residents' perspectives on regional energy transition and regional future developments to set the basis for finding shared solutions, thereby advancing energy transition in spatial and energy planning. A standardized questionnaire (N = 907) containing a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) was used to investigate and gain insights into residents' perspectives on energy transition and their preferred future regional developments in the Swiss region of Knonauer Amt. The results highlight three main findings: (i) skepticism toward energy transition often comes from a perceived lack of benefits rather than from concerns about impacts on the landscape; (ii) perspectives on energy transition and on regional development are closely linked, meaning that they should be discussed together in regional strategic planning; and (iii) incorporating residents' perspectives early in future-oriented energy planning offers strong potential for developing shared solutions. These findings contribute to the identification of pathways for developing shared solutions in energy transition planning.},

  abstract             = {The `second phase' of the energy transition involves large-scale rollout of renewables, raising wider questions about arrangements for the management and ownership of such resources and how costs and benefits should be distributed. Ideas and practices such as `community energy' and `prosumption' capture the potential for more decentralised systems of ownership and control inherent in renewable energy technologies. However, until now, ownership and control of the key biophysical resources (e.g., wind, wave, solar, geothermal) underpinning the transition have received surprisingly little attention, given the potential for wealth creation and issues of justice that underpin their use. This paper explores this issue using the idea of `wind rights', which highlights the numerous social actors who have rights or claims to use and benefit from wind resources. Key among these are landowners who are silently enclosing the `windy commons' to extract `wind rents' from monopoly property rights. This has profound (but undertheorised) distributive and structural ramifications for the energy transition. Despite this, and with some recent notable exceptions, much energy transition research in social science and humanities portrays landowners as taken-for-granted, apolitical, and sometimes marginal (ised) stakeholders. Combining a Marxist, class-based approach to landownership and wind rent with Ostromian institutional analysis, this paper reviews and expands the (predominantly legal) literature on wind rights. This deepens the understanding of the concept of `wind rights', highlighting that in many instances wind resources are de facto privatised/enclosed via `proxy wind rights' for landowners. We also indicate some alternative wind rights configurations, including nationally and commonly managed wind resources. This analysis leads to a consideration of the potential long-term benefits of alternative socially orientated property rights arrangements, including community wind rights or nationalisation of the wind resource. These social wind rights arrangements could play a key role in securing a more just and widely supported transition.},

Yet very little empirical research aimed at understanding this kind of energy transition has been published to date. In this paper, we present findings from an analysis of five large, mainstream (CBC, Globe and Mail, National Post, Vancouver Sun, Toronto Star) and Indigenous (APTN) Canadian media outlets from 2008 to 2017 (n = 153). Using Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) and energy justice frameworks, we are interested in the ways Indigenous Peoples are being written about and perceived among the Canadian public. We use content analysis to understand more about the types of issues being brought forth into the public eye, and critical discourse analysis to assess each outlet's telling and framing of these stories. Findings indicate that stories of Indigenous opposition to large scale hydro development dominate our sample - articles of protest, lawsuits, and threats to nation-to-nation-building that are more commonly seen in extractive industries. Stories covering other technologies (e.g. solar, wind) showcase excitement, positive socio-economic benefit, and opportunities for reconciliation. Second, and against the backdrop of historical misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples, we find what some may deem exemplars of fair coverage of Indigenous Peoples and renewable energy. Despite the absence of overt racist phrases - as seen in the recent past - authors rarely attend to the colonial history that has created structural issues prevalent in communities today. In the face of long-standing (energy) injustices, we question how far the coverage goes towards raising alternative and Indigenous perspectives. We close the paper with what we see as potential for future research trajectories to critically consider the role of the news media in addressing nation-to-nation relationships in Canada and other colonized territories.},

They are also being associated with the ``four Ds,'' whereby Local Smart Grids are decarbonizing, decentralizing, digitalizing, and potentially democratizing energy systems. Yet, due to their recent arrival, there is very little social scientific research that has aimed to better understand public views, expectations, and support for this change. We attempt to fill this important gap in the literature through the analysis of two nationally representative surveys in the UK (n = 3034) and Canada (n = 941). This analysis highlights within- and between-country trends, including how the variation in responses regarding the ``four Ds,'' demographic factors, and other variables may explain the differences we see in terms of support for energy system change in the UK and Canada. Our analysis also shows that there are common elements, including the importance of the decentralization, and especially the democratization of energy in shaping support. We hope that this study will help governments, industry, community groups, and local residents themselves in both countries come together to advance the kind of Local Smart Grids that address climate change and represent a supported, just energy transition.

Clean energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics and wind power, can substantially contribute to a more sustainable world and have been around for decades. However, the fast pace at which they are projected to be deployed in the United States (US) and the world poses numerous technical and nontechnical challenges, such as in terms of their integration into the electricity grid, public opposition and competition for land use. For instance, as more land-based wind turbines are built across the US, contention risks may become more acute. This article presents a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) that minimizes contention risks and maximizes renewable energy production during siting decisions. As a proof-of-concept, the methodology is tested on a case study of wind turbine siting in Illinois during the 2022-2035 period. Results show that using RL halves potential delays due to contention compared to a random decision process. This approach could be further developed to study the acceptance of offshore wind projects or other clean energy technologies.},

  abstract             = {This paper presents a novel approach to identifying reskilling requirements, job merging pathways, and a tentative timeline for transforming offshore oil and gas drilling occupations amid the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0). The proposed algorithm focuses on potential job merging due to technological adoption. It introduces a scaling factor named digital readiness level to incorporate modulation factors (e.g., cost of development and deployment of new technologies, labour market dynamics, economic benefits, regulatory readiness, and social acceptance) that act as catalysts or hindrances for technology adoption. A feature-based approach is developed to assess the similarities between occupations, while a mathematical model is developed to project automation trajectories for each job under investigation. These facilitate the consideration of potential job merging scenarios and the associated timeline. Since technology adoption depends on the industry, region, occupation, and stakeholder's ability to manage the transformation, the proposed algorithm is presented as a case study on Canadian offshore oil and gas drilling occupations. However, this algorithm and approach can be applied to other industries or occupation structures. The proposed algorithm projects that the total number of personnel on board (POB) in a typical offshore drilling platform will be reduced to six by 2058. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm against variations in the feature values and weighting factors. It was found that when changing feature values and weighting factors up to +/- 20% of their original values, only one job that remains after 2058 follows three different job merging pathways, while others remain unchanged. Even the job that followed three different pathways was composed of the same source jobs compared to the corresponding job in the baseline results.The adoption of digital technologies, such as automation, robotization, digital twins, data-driven decision-making systems, smart devices, and cloud computing technologies, gradually transform existing workplaces into digitally-enabled smart workplaces. Therefore, stakeholders must invest in training programs to reskill existing workforces and to orient prospective employees to work at these smart workplaces. If technology adoption occurs at a rapid or slower pace than workforce reformation, industries cannot gain the optimum benefit from their digital transformation initiatives. Also, human capital investments may not generate much benefit if technology adoption and workforce reformation occur at different rates. Therefore, this work presents a novel framework to predict future employment scenarios, particularly for the workers in offshore oil and gas drilling activities, along with a tentative timeline. Stakeholders can utilize the proposed framework to effectively plan the pace of technological adoption, future workforce transformation and human capital investments.},

The adoption of renewable resources can act as a peacemaker and give stability regarding the damaging effects of fossil fuels challenging public health as well as the tension made between countries in global prices of oil and gas. Understanding the potential and capabilities to produce renewable energy resources is a crucial pre-requisite for countries to utilize them and to scale up clean and stable sources of electricity generation. This paper presents a hybrid methodology that combines the data envelopment analysis (DEA) Window model, and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) in order to evaluate the capabilities of 42 countries in terms of renewable energy production potential. Based on three inputs (population, total energy consumption, and total renewable energy capacity) and two outputs (gross domestic product and total energy production), DEA window analysis chose the list of potential countries, including Norway, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Australia, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, United States, Japan, Colombia, and Italy. Following that, the FTOPSIS model pointed out the top three countries (United States, Japan, and Australia) that have the greatest capabilities in producing renewable energies based on five main criteria, which are available resources, energy security, technological infrastructure, economic stability, and social acceptance. This paper aims to offer an evaluation method for countries to understand their potential of renewable energy production in designing stimulus packages for a cleaner energy future, thereby accelerating sustainable development.},

This review seeks to clarify the different perspectives surrounding the concept, to consolidate knowledge, and to provide a concise account of current debates in the literature as well as a research agenda. It identifies five themes around which the concept has been discussed: (1) just transition as a labor-oriented concept, (2) just transition as an integrated framework for justice, (3) just transition as a theory of socio-technical transition, (4) just transition as a governance strategy, and (5) just transition as public perception. Overall, this review suggests that the literature on just transition employs rich theoretical and empirical insights from various disciplines yet contains several gaps. Specifically, it argues that the literature would benefit from more empirical studies rooted in practice, more discussion on the relationship between different concepts of just transition, an expansion of geographical scope to include developing countries and non-democratic regimes, and more attention to power dynamics in just transition.},

The results show that: 1) social network has a significant impact on the willingness of villagers to adopt rooftop PV products. 2) Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived risk play multiple mediating roles. 3) The parallel mediating effect of villagers' perceived risk on the relationship between social network and adoption intention is much higher than the other two paths. 4) The chain mediating effect of perceived risk and perceived ease of use on the relationship between social network and villagers' adoption intention is much higher than the other two paths.

In this paper, we construct a model to explore the role of rooted and multidimensional social capital on villagers' willingness to adopt residential rooftop PV (RRPV). We also identified the characteristics of rural information transmission and opinion leaders in this process. The results show that (1) structural and relational social capital promote villagers' willingness to adopt RRPV through two mechanisms: information transmission and social influence, with the former being stronger. (2) Structural social capital tends to play a role through villagers' usefulness, benefits and environmental perceptions, whereas relational social capital tends to focus on ease of use, cost and risk perceptions. In addition, villagers' psychological perceptions play a mediating role. (3) There are multiple opinion leaders in the same village who are no longer respected elders but have heterogeneous information. Factories outside and entertainment places inside the village are also identified as sources of information. (4) The information transmission network of rural RRPV shows an obvious ripple effect, and structural holes widely exist.

Using the system dynamics (SD) approach, we capture the intricate feedback mechanisms among market share dynamics, cost considerations, consumer preferences, and competitive interactions within the bus market. These interactions are encapsulated within three pivotal feedback loops: scale economy, public acceptance, and bus market competition. We systematically integrate the HK -specific features of hydrogen buses (H -buses), battery electric buses (E -buses), and diesel buses (D -buses) from technical and economic perspectives and compare them to the benchmark scenario. The results show that only 66% of the bus fleet would be ZEBs by 2050, and this underscores the necessity for governmental financial incentives to expedite the transition to a fully zero -emission fleet. Furthermore, we evaluate various ZEB subsidy policy alternatives in terms of timing, intensity, and recipients. The analysis suggests that policies offering long-term and low -intensity subsidies are most beneficial, taking into account the cumulative effects and inherent delays associated with policy implementation. Importantly, the study highlights the critical balance that policymakers must achieve between short- and long-term objectives, especially given the counter -intuitive outcomes observed in the early stages of policies favoring Hbuses exclusively. This study provides valuable policy insights for policymakers and upstream energy companies in HK, with potential applicability in wider real -world contexts.},

  abstract      = {Energy issues are crucial for Scotland. This paper reviews the environmental, social and political questions surrounding energy and environment in general, and analyses the passionate arguments surrounding onshore wind farm developments in Scotland in particular. Scotland has the best onshore and offshore wind resources in Europe, with almost a quarter of the total resource, and onshore wind is now rapidly overtaking hydropower as the renewable technology with the greatest generating capacity. This development has proved highly controversial, with many schemes attracting vociferous public opposition. This review explores the main issues involved and shows that whilst some of the controversy centres on factual issues such as job creation, intermittency or bird mortality, a primary reason why consensus is so elusive is that conflicting values lie at the core of the debate. Issues such as landscape aesthetics, community (dis)empowerment and the relative importance of global and local factors are perceptual, unquantifiable and shaped by personal world views. Consequently, even if all the misinformation provided by those supporting or opposing wind farms was removed, profound disagreements would remain about the appropriate choices for securing Scotland's future power supply. The paper highlights the need to deepen our understanding of the social construction of public attitudes, to develop better criteria for strategic locational guidance and to investigate the potential of emerging development models such as community-scale wind power schemes.},

Research on social acceptance of wind energy has increased rapidly, but understanding still lacks regarding the different types of acceptance, whether or not the acceptance correlates with demographics, and what drives acceptance of wind farms in the urban landscape. Our analysis of 2,376 residents in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, focused on the gaps in understanding and identified three groups of people: Protagonists, Centrists, and Antagonists. While Protagonists are highly positive about wind energy projects in the city, Antagonists oppose them, and Centrists adopt a middle-of-the-road approach. Further, three factors matter for social acceptance in urban landscapes: 1) distance, as residents prefer offshore wind farms to be farther away from the city's inhabitants, 2) gender, as women are more accepting of wind energy compared with men, and outright opponents of wind energy are more likely men, and 3) participation, as residents wish to participate in decision-making processes regarding wind farms, but lack interest in having ownership of and responsibility for wind energy projects. The study discusses the implications of these findings for developers and policymakers of wind energy projects in the urban context.},

A fragmented literature has emerged investigating public engagement with these technologies and the determinants of public acceptance, comprising 59 key studies-the majority investigating offshore wind energy (59%). This literature review argues that while the ways in which public actors engage with offshore renewable energy are to some extent similar to onshore energy infrastructure, there are also important differences. These include the generally lower levels of public knowledge about the technologies, a changing role for visual impacts, a fundamentally different, marine, spatial context, and different sets of stakeholders in different decision-making arenas. There is a need to explore as yet unasked and unanswered questions-going beyond `established' variables identified in the onshore wind-based `beyond NIMBY' literature-especially regarding the role of the marine location of these technologies, and the cross-technology and cross-disciplinary applicability of findings. In order to more fully understand public responses to energy infrastructures, future research needs to move beyond case studies of onshore wind developments, adopting more diverse and ambitious research designs and methodologies.

This review paper provides an overview of the (1) technical, (2) economic, (3) socio-political, and (4) regulatory and institutional aspects that should be considered concurrently when navigating the transition towards a rooftop PV-dominated electricity system. We consider the suitability of two prominent long-range transitions theories for understanding the importance and interaction of elements within these four aspects during the transition. The multi-level perspective (MLP) of transitions theory is considered best suited for this task as it addresses fundamental shifts in the socio-technical systems, rather than being weighted towards technological and/or economic solutions. We find that relatively little research has been undertaken where the renewable energy transition is being driven by the uptake of rooftop PV within the distribution network of established islanded electricity systems. These islanded electricity systems will be the first to experience system impacts from high levels of rooftop PV. This review provides further analysis of important gaps in understanding the rooftop-PV-led energy transition and the implications for policy makers in maintaining stable electricity supplies during the transition.},

Governments must implement policies that are environmentally friendly, cost-effective, but, most of all, socially acceptable. Social acceptance risk plays a significant role in Poland, influencing the decarbonisation process. In Poland's case, the coal share is decreasing, but it is still the most important fuel for electricity production. This process of decarbonisation is a fundamental influence on the transformation of the energy sector in Poland. The social perception of solutions that can be applied was examined. The Polish natural environment is poisoned. Poles suffer from diseases related to the burning of coal for energy production.

  abstract             = {Efforts such as the Glasgow United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 26, the Paris Agreement (Paris agreement, United Nations, Paris, 2015) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are supporting the drive to protect the planet from global warming by ensuring sustainable development. The oil and gas industry, as key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, must transition to more sustainable energy solutions and play their part in reducing these emissions. Currently, oil and gas companies are implementing technical solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. The energy transition from fossil fuel reliance has also happened by exploiting alternative renewable energy sources to meet global energy demand such as wind, solar, biogas and bioderived feedstocks. This net zero energy transition will require a fair and just transition for all in society, and to implement this, it is crucial for those working in the oil and gas industry to understand the technologies needed, the importance of carbon policies and their roles. This research presents a modified Delphi study of employees in Malaysia's national oil and gas company to understand their perceptions towards a net-zero carbon future. The paper briefly reviews Malaysia's low-carbon policy plans, its current carbon dioxide accounting balance, and identifies potential technologies for decarbonisation to set the scene for the modified Delphi study. The results indicated that the national oil and gas company has both the capabilities and the financial resources to significantly contribute towards Malaysia transitioning to a carbon neutral nation. This can be achieved by implementing advanced technologies complementing with nature-based solutions to realise net zero carbon emissions. This study also portrays the confidence that the portfolio of solutions should be executed through a coordinated effort to maximise the outcome and minimise the financial impact in terms of economical sustainability. Implementation of activities towards this energy transition will require significant social commitment, and hence, gauging their perception towards this journey is key objective of this paper.

  abstract             = {Despite the increase in the usage of renewable energy in Malaysia, the proportion of renewable energy (RE) within the energy mix lags far behind satisfactory levels, at a mere 23% in 2020 compared to the 31% target by 2025 as per Malaysia's Energy Transition Roadmap. The public acceptance towards RE is one of the many obstacles that hinders the proliferation of RE in Malaysia. It is therefore imperative to determine the key factors which shape an individual's intention to utilize RE. In this study, three models are compared and assessed in terms of their efficacy in predicting such behavioural intention, namely the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and an extended model that combines the characteristics of the two prior theories. Partial-least-squares structural equation modelling, finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIXPLS), and important-performance map analysis (IPMA) were performed on the collected survey dataset with 524 responses. Analyses revealed that attitude and perceived behavioural control are important factors of intention to adopt renewable energy technology, with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in turn being significant antecedents of attitude, whereas subjective norm did not influence intention. Among the three models, the extended model triumphs in terms of path significance and explanatory power, followed by TPB and then TAM. Results show that costs, ease of use and accessibility of RE remain limiting factors towards RE adoption in Malaysia, hence the need of appropriate policies/programmes, such as targeted incentive campaigns, to alleviate this issue.},

  abstract        = {The energy poverty cycle remains a twofold barrier as part of energy transitions. Nations must support the provision of affordable and reliable power and concurrently address nationally agreed carbon reduction targets. Decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) is a viable option to achieve universal energy access in rural areas, while it concurrently decarbonises energy generation, but often remains in tension with traditional centralised generation and distribution systems. Lack of awareness of PV technologies is seen as one of the major barriers limiting the deployment of decentralised systems in rural areas. This study explores awareness of PV systems drawing from over 700 household semi-structured surveys within Uttar Pradesh, India. We found existing awareness-raising campaigns, and subsidies for promoting PV technologies in rural areas are not effective with households preferring word of mouth, experiential learning and village-level awareness programmes than conventional electronic and print media advertising, as preferred by the government and private sectors. This lack of awareness also extends to subsidies for solar PV otherwise used to support this technology deployment and transition. We suggest locally organised and locally delivered targeted campaigns covering product knowledge, functionality and information on financing provisions for procuring solar PV system including how this relates to subsidies could be more effective to promote solar PV in the rural market. As public awareness precedes solar PV adoption, these findings can be insightful for policymakers, investors and the private enterprises to improve existing informational programmes and devise effective campaigns supporting the demand and therefore development of rural solar PV market.

Barriers and enablers that are key in selecting the most suitable renewable energy sources for developing economies for the renewable energy development have been identified from extensive analyses of research documents alongside qualitative data from the Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The selected FGD participants encompass the collective views that cut across the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental aspects of renewable energy development in Indonesia. The information gained from the FGD gives insights into the outlook and challenges that are central to energy transition within the country, alongside the perceptions of renewable energy development from the influential stakeholders contributing to the process. It is notable that the biggest barriers to transition are centred on planning and implementation aspects, as it is also evident that many in the community do not adhere to the same vision.},

  abstract             = {The energy transition toward Net Zero Emission by 2060 hinges on the renewable energy power plants in Indonesia. Good practices in several countries suggest a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading system using blockchain technology, supported by renewable energy (solar panels), an innovation to provide equal access to sustainable electricity while reducing the impact of climate change. The P2P energy trading concept has a higher social potential than the conventional electricity buying and selling approach, such as that of PLN (the state-owned electricity company in Indonesia), which applies the network management concept but does not have a sharing element. This model implements a solar-powered mini-grid system and produces a smart contract that facilitates electricity network users to buy, sell, and trade electricity in rural areas via smartphones. This study aims to measure the stakeholders' perceptions of the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading model using blockchain technology in the Gumelar District, Banyumas Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. The stakeholders in question are representatives of Households (producers and consumers), Government, State Electricity Company (PLN), Non-Governmental Organizations, Private Sector and Academician. Measurement of perception in this study used a questionnaire approach with a Likert scale. The results of filling out the questionnaire were analyzed using four methods: IFE/EFE matrix; IE matrix; SWOT matrix; and SPACE matrix to assess the results and their suitability to each other. The results of the stakeholder perception assessment show that there are 44 internal factors and 33 external factors that can influence this model. We obtained an IFE and EFE score of 2.92 and 2.83 for the internal and external results using the IE matrix. These place the model in quadrant V, meaning the P2P model can survive in the long term to generate profits. Based on the SWOT analysis results, this model is located at the coordinate point -0.40, 0.31, placing it in quadrant II. This means that the P2P model is in a competitive situation and faces threats but still has internal strengths. Based on the SPACE matrix, stakeholder perception states that the P2P model is at coordinate point 1, -0.3. This shows that the P2P model has the potential to be a competitive advantage in its type of activity that continues to grow. In conclusion, our findings show that stakeholders' perceptions of P2P models using blockchain technology can be implemented effectively and provide social, economic, and environmental incentives.},

This research focuses on a developing country heavily reliant on imported electricity and evaluates the potential of renewable energy resources. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM), this study prioritizes sustainable energy resources crucial for energy security and environmental sustainability, given the country's dependence on traditional and imported power and its potential for renewable energy development. This study employs AHP to evaluate and rank various sustainable energy options, emphasizing their technological, economic, environmental, and social impacts. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive and systematic approach to integrating diverse expert opinions and utilizing AHP; the development of a robust decision-making model that accommodates the diverse criteria and sub-criteria (SCs) influencing the prioritization of energy resources; and its bridging of the gaps through the integration of varied criteria and SCs, region-specific concerns, and stakeholders' engagement by creating a comprehensive and inclusive prioritization strategy. The key findings highlight solar energy as the most viable sustainable energy resource, followed by wind and hydro energy. These results underscore the significant potential for solar energy development, considering its current technological advancements, economic affordability, social acceptance, and environmental friendliness. This study not only provides a prioritized list of sustainable energy resources but also offers a methodological framework adaptable for similar assessments in other regions facing energy transition challenges. Readers will find a detailed explanation of the AHP methodology, the criteria used for evaluating energy resources, and the implications of the findings for policy and decision making. This research is particularly relevant for policymakers, energy planners, and stakeholders interested in sustainable energy development and strategic planning in similar contexts.},

Conversely, developing countries tend to be locked in fossil fuels and foster coal-based energy structures, emphasizing reliable and cost-effective energy provision and sidelining environmental concerns. In this study, we identified and analysed the predominant factors related to coal-based power generation in Bangladesh. We applied a mixed-method approach, initially conducting a systematic literature review and, subsequently, semi structured expert interviews to identify and validate relevant factors. We then assessed their relative importance using an Analytical Hierarchy Process based on expert judgments. The results of this assessment reveal that socio-economic aspects and environmental issues scored highest, while technological aspects and sector regulations were considered to be less relevant for large-scale coal power implementation. We conclude that future energy policies created in Bangladesh will need to use appropriate legal instruments and address issues such as human displacement and resettlement, low levels of public acceptance, health hazards and environmental pollution. Participative policy frameworks should be deployed in coal plant projects, and active monitoring systems are necessary to reduce the negative consequences associated with increased electrification and energy consumption. To address foreseeable structural challenges, it furthermore will be crucial to explore sustainable alternatives.},

An empirical study is conducted in which a semantic differential is used to assess emotional evaluation of wind power, solar power (PV) and biomass for electricity production. Furthermore, general acceptance of the technologies was assessed. It was found that not only did the technologies differ in terms of emotional responses they evoked, but that those responses also varied significantly between groups of high and low levels of acceptance concerning the respective energy technology. By analyzing spontaneous associations with the three energy sources, possible reasons for the affective evaluations were identified, which can provide essential topics for the communication about those technologies. Overall, the three renewable energy technologies revealed different emotional evaluations which might considerably impact the overall acceptance. It is argued that knowledge about such affective perceptions is useful to tailor energy technology development in early phases and to steer public information and communication strategies.},

While for technical disciplines, the focus is on the development of technologies which can supply, transmit and store energy in a sustainable way, economic research focuses for example on the analyses of costs and risks of different asset portfolios. Yet another perspective is taken by the social sciences who focus on social challenges associated with the implementation of measures for realizing the Energiewende (decarbonization, high energy efficiency, high shares of renewables, nuclear phaseout), for example their acceptability. A solution for energy supply and storage which is optimized only according to one of these perspectives will, however, fail to meet other essential criteria. To develop sustainable solutions for energy supply and storage, which are technically feasible, cost-effective, and supported by local residents, interdisciplinary cooperation of researchers is thus needed. Interdisciplinary research, however, is subject to many barriers, for example the need to agree on a common analytical framework. In this paper, a process model for interdisciplinary energy research is proposed, in which specific scenarios are used to aid interdisciplinary cooperation and reciprocal integration of results. Based on a current research project, the phases of the model and the use of the scenarios in disciplinary and interdisciplinary work packages are described, as well as challenges and shortcomings of the model.},

What role do ocean and wind energy play in a cost effective, technically feasible long-term low carbon energy system? We study the necessary technological learning of tidal energy with UKTM (a long running energy system model) and analyse the impacts of adding tidal to the electricity system with highRES (a high spatial and temporal resolution electricity system model). We find that while tidal energy reduces the need for investment into flexible generation, it does so less than the spatial diversification of already existing renewable energy sources.

However, we know little about the attitude of the Chinese public toward EU's energy role or EU-China energy cooperation. The paper contributes to the study of relationship between agenda-setting and public opinion in the context of Chinese social media. Using empirical data, it finds that energy cooperation, energy trading, energy politics, and energy technology&service are the four co-occurrence networks of Chinese public discussion on the topic. Yet the opinion leaders differ on these issues. While verified media accounts are key opinion leaders setting the agenda in EU energy politics and trade issues, in energy technology and service issues, verified individual accounts lead opinions. The study helps understand the role of online opinion leaders in EU-China energy relations and argues that key opinion leaders need to play more active roles in communicating the issues and guiding public discussions.},

  abstract      = {Historically, long-waves have characterized transformations of the energy systems. There is not much reason to assume that our current energy system is here to stay. One possible future option is that renewables will provide all energy needed. While many scenarios exist showing that this is technically feasible, the related costs, speed of technology diffusion and social and political acceptance of such an energy transition are fiercely debated, both in the scientific field as well as in politics. Yet, there is growing consensus that renewables are becoming established as a key building block in the energy system, irrespective of the exact shares they represent. The focus should shift from a debate surrounding the feasibility of a 100% renewable system to how we can enable a speedy and immediate upscaling.},

Article draws attention to the close relationship between the perception of economic challenges and of threats to social security and attitudes towards climate and environmental issues among the residents of coal basins. These multidimensional factors shaping opinions on energy transition ultimately translate into ideological and political sympathies. Based on the results of surveys carried out on a sample of 1000 people living in the region, the author defends the thesis that energy transition cannot be treated only as a process of technological change or a bundle of single regional economic transformations resulting from decarbonisation, particularly in regions dependent on the mining industry. The obtained results indicate that not only does the current economic and financial situation of coal basin residents shape their attitudes to the decarbonisation process, but also their anticipated personal material situation after the closure of the mine and the implementation of energy transition may have a great impact on the current assessment of transition goals as well as their perception of climate change and the negative effects of the mining industry.},

  abstract             = {New technologies are necessary for energy system transition and meeting climate targets. However, obstacles to social acceptance, often linked to limited understanding and awareness, impede their integration. This article focuses on the acceptance of seasonal thermal energy storage technologies. This energy technology enables the storage of surplus heat in summer for heating in winter and the transfer of cold from winter to summer for cooling purposes. Combining theoretical insights from research on public opinion formation and social acceptance, this article constructs a model to explore how different information framings and formats influence individual opinion formation and the social acceptance of these technologies. It presents data from an experiment conducted in Switzerland through two online cross-sectional surveys (N = 1749; N = 614). The participants were given varied information framing conditions and formats. Based on independent sample t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and generalized structural equation models, the findings reveal that providing identical information in a video rather than as text increases general technology acceptance directly, as well as indirectly through reduced information complexity. Emphasizing technological readiness also positively affects general technology acceptance. However, these effects do not extend to more concrete market and community acceptance. The research highlights the significance of tailored and accessible information in facilitating information processing for unknown (energy) technologies in enhancing their social acceptance.},

By building on approaches and concepts from the Sustainability Transitions research field, the article explores perceptions, values, and concerns regarding distributed and centralized energy models; inclusivity and energy democracy; energy systems' sustainability concerns and the speed of the transition. The study draws on the hypothesis that stakeholders across the state, market, community and third sector spheres, while equally supporting decarbonization, have different perceptions, values, and concerns regarding the social, environmental, and technological dynamics of the energy transition that need to be better understood for accelerating the transition. The multi-method approach included interviews, a survey (N = 110) and a stakeholder workshop, to unpack the key values and preferences around energy system technologies, sustainability and inclusionary aspects, the role of centralized and distributed energy systems and new investments, namely in green hydrogen and lithium mining. The results indicate there is a significant convergence on the fact that decarbonization is a priority that needs to be supported by inclusive and democratic processes. Decentralization, energy communities and solar energy are extremely valued, and transparency and information sharing are crucial expectations for new lithium mining projects, large-scale solar and green hydrogen investments. These findings outline some avenues for future research, where participation and transparency become anchors for a sustainable and inclusive transition.},

  abstract   = {Inspired by the energy democracy movement, this conceptual review critically explores relationships between concentrated or distributed renewable energy and political power. Advocates assert that because the renewable energy transition is fundamentally a political struggle, efforts to shift from fossil fuels and decarbonize societies will not prove effective without confronting and destabilizing dominant systems of energy power. The objectives of this paper include: 1) theorizing and exploring the relationships between renewable energy and political power, 2) critically assessing tensions associated with an energy democracy agenda, and 3) drawing out the implications for democratizing renewable energy development in practice. Distributed energy-politics posits that distributed energy sources and technologies enable and organize distributed political power and vice versa. Efforts are underway to find ways to re-organize distributed energy flows into aggregated and concentrated stocks of energy and other forms of political power. More democratic renewable energy futures may benefit from strengthening democratic practices and outcomes, extending democratization of energy systems across all components, stages and end uses, and sharpening positions relative to dominant pressures of capitalism and market ideology, the ideology of unlimited growth, and the modernist/industrialist agenda. Renewable energy systems offer a possibility but not a certainty for more democratic energy futures.},

  abstract    = {In this report, we present a framework for mapping the ethical dilemmas that arise in the development of offshore wind parks in the North Sea. The development of new technologies, such as offshore wind parks, gives rise to ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas can be characterised in terms of conflicts between relevant values, which we identified through a review of the literature on the ethics of technology and through consultation with stakeholders. With the input of stakeholders, these values have then been systematically categorised so they can be interpreted in terms of ethical dilemmas. Our analysis of the input from the stakeholder workshop reveals a deep concern for balancing the Dutch energy transition with the ecological preservation of the North Sea and its ecosystems. When identifying values, stakeholders noted that it is important that the energy transition is not considered in isolation from other pressures on the North Sea. This includes other significant energy-related developments, such as gas exploration and deep-sea mining in the North Sea. Stakeholders observed that the current EU regulations are not adequately addressing these cumulative pressures caused by wind farms, other activities in the North Sea, and the impact of climate change. Therefore, stakeholders believe that EU-level and Dutch-level regulations should reflect these complexities in a more ethically informed manner. Our reflections also highlight the need for adaptive policies and institutions that would better reflect the complexities of cumulative pressures on the North Sea in a more ethically informed manner, accounting for evolving knowledge and values; the moral responsibilities not only of the Netherlands but also of other countries impacting the North Sea; and the long-term sustainability of energy infrastructure development. At its core, the output of the stakeholder workshop is not limited to the exploration of offshore wind energy but expands to questioning how to ensure that the Dutch energy transition contributes to climate goals without disproportionately harming the North Sea or creating new, unforeseen environmental and societal challenges. In other words, based on our analysis of the insights from the workshop, we can confirm that the question is broader than environmental concerns regarding, for instance, bird mortality. The executed study shows the necessity of understanding the relations between spatial, temporal, and environmental challenges. From this perspective, ethical issues exceed an isolated focus on the ecological impacts of offshore wind energy to signify the importance of ethical scrutiny of cumulative and interrelated effects of Dutch energy transition development on the North Sea. Our recommendations expand on a proposed integrated values-oriented research agenda for the Dutch energy transition.},
