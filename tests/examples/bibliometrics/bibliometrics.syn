    text: In media coverage, the context of the German energy transition, also referred to as Energiewende, casts a spotlight not only on various technology options (e.g. wind or coal power) but also on more abstract topics such as security of supply or electricity prices. Thereby, the public's assessment of energy-related issues may greatly rely on perceived risks.

ITEM @schmidt2017a
    text: Although the media's effect on actual risk perception involves some controversies, researchers tend to criticize the media as being susceptible to framing and for failing to place unwanted events in perspective, e.g. by not presenting the corresponding likelihood of occurrence, which is necessary to define risk.

    text: Results from a questionnaire-based survey indicate a mean WTP of 3072 DKK (412 EUR) per household per year. This correspondents to a 12\% increase in heat and electricity expenses.

    note: Quantifies economic burden threshold: 12% cost increase reveals magnitude of public willingness to bear financial costs for negative emissions technology.

ITEM @ugarte-lucas2024
    text: The need for negative emissions is the main stated reason for WTP. This may be interpreted as reflecting either support for, or reluctant acceptance of, BECCS.

    note: Reveals ambiguity mechanism: perceived necessity drives payment willingness but cannot distinguish genuine support from resigned acceptance, indicating complex motivational pathways.

ITEM @ugarte-lucas2024
    text: Results show that being younger, being concerned about climate change and believing that it is mainly caused by human activity, and believing in the mitigation potential of biomass and that sustainability is a precondition of its use have a significant effect on WTP.

    note: *complex* Five-factor convergence (age, climate concern, causality belief, mitigation belief, sustainability belief) indicates payment willingness requires integrated cognitive-affective alignment across multiple domains.

    chain: Age -> INFLUENCES -> Willingness_to_Pay

    note: Climate concern operates as affective driver: emotional engagement with climate issue increases financial commitment to mitigation technology.

    chain: Climate_Concern -> INFLUENCES -> Willingness_to_Pay

    note: Causal attribution mechanism: belief in anthropogenic causation strengthens sense of responsibility, increasing willingness to bear mitigation costs.

    chain: Causality_Belief -> INFLUENCES -> Willingness_to_Pay

    note: Efficacy belief pathway: confidence in biomass mitigation potential enables financial commitment by reducing perceived investment risk.

    chain: Mitigation_Belief -> INFLUENCES -> Willingness_to_Pay

    note: Conditional support mechanism: sustainability precondition belief acts as moral gatekeeper, where payment willingness depends on ethical technology implementation standards.

    text: While verified media accounts are key opinion leaders setting the agenda in EU energy politics and trade issues, in energy technology and service issues, verified individual accounts lead opinions.

    note: Reveals domain-specific mechanism: Media shapes political/trade discourse while individuals shape technical discourse, indicating differentiated communication pathways.

    text: This review paper provides an overview of the (1) technical, (2) economic, (3) socio-political, and (4) regulatory and institutional aspects that should be considered concurrently when navigating the transition towards a rooftop PV-dominated electricity system.

    note: *complex* Four-domain convergence (technical, economic, socio-political, regulatory) reveals transition requires integrated concurrent intervention across multiple system dimensions

ITEM @wilkinson2021
    text: The multi-level perspective (MLP) of transitions theory is considered best suited for this task as it addresses fundamental shifts in the socio-technical systems, rather than being weighted towards technological and/or economic solutions.

    text: Conversely, developing countries tend to be locked in fossil fuels and foster coal-based energy structures, emphasizing reliable and cost-effective energy provision and sidelining environmental concerns.

ITEM @yadav2020
    text: We found existing awareness-raising campaigns, and subsidies for promoting PV technologies in rural areas are not effective with households preferring word of mouth, experiential learning and village-level awareness programmes than conventional electronic and print media advertising, as preferred by the government and private sectors.

    note: *complex* Campaign effectiveness constrained by channel mismatch: government uses mass media while households prefer interpersonal local channels.

END ITEM

ITEM @yadav2020
    text: We suggest locally organised and locally delivered targeted campaigns covering product knowledge, functionality and information on financing provisions for procuring solar PV system including how this relates to subsidies could be more effective to promote solar PV in the rural market.

ITEM @zuk2023
    text: The obtained results indicate that not only does the current economic and financial situation of coal basin residents shape their attitudes to the decarbonisation process, but also their anticipated personal material situation after the closure of the mine and the implementation of energy transition may have a great impact on the current assessment of transition goals as well as their perception of climate change and the negative effects of the mining industry.

    note: *complex* Three-factor convergence (current economic situation, anticipated deprivation, social security) reveals temporal mechanism where both present and anticipated future conditions independently shape transition attitudes

    chain: Economic_Situation -> INFLUENCES -> Transition_Attitude

    note: Anticipated future deprivation operates as independent mechanism shaping current attitudes, revealing temporal dimension of acceptance

    text: Article draws attention to the close relationship between the perception of economic challenges and of threats to social security and attitudes towards climate and environmental issues among the residents of coal basins. These multidimensional factors shaping opinions on energy transition ultimately translate into ideological and political sympathies.

    note: Sequential mechanism: Economic and security perceptions shape transition attitudes which then crystallize into political ideology

ITEM @gibbs2023
    text: A comparative case study of two global software organizations involved in offshore outsourcing reveals that global contractors across sites constructed different equity perceptions of similar foreign assignments due to a number of contextual factors.
